They are often used in cases when input data are dynamically changing as new users and content items, such as news, constantly change. Contextual bandit methods sequentially select articles for recommendation to a user and continuously modify their strategies so as to present users with articles that maximize clicks. However, exclusively focusing on maximizing the number of clicks can lead to over-exposure of certain articles, while under-representing others. In an era of ever growing demand for digital news delivery, this, in turn, invokes the important notion of presenting news content to users in a “socially responsible” way. To this effect, we introduce a technique based on the contextual bandit framework that, in addition to maximization of the click rate, also considers historical frequency of an article as the “cost” associated with recommending it. It is demonstrated that this approach results in a more balanced distribution and a diverse set of recommended articles. Experiments utilizing a benchmark news dataset demonstrate the trade-off between clicks and diversity of recommended articles. © 2021","2022","2022-03-24 08:56:02","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Semenov2022 tex.affiliation: Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering.

Letting automated processes take decisions raises the question of their accountability. In the field of computational journalism, the algorithmic accountability framework proposed by Diakopoulos formalizes this challenge by considering algorithms as objects of human creation, with the goal of revealing the intent embedded into their implementation. A consequence of this definition is that ensuring accountability essentially boils down to a transparency question: given the appropriate reverse-engineering tools, it should be feasible to extract design criteria and to identify intentional biases. General limitations of this transparency ideal have been discussed by Ananny and Crawford (New Media Soc 20(3):973–989, 2018). We further focus on its technical limitations. We show that even if reverse-engineering concludes that the criteria embedded into an algorithm correspond to its publicized intent, it may be that adversarial behaviors make the algorithm deviate from its expected operation. We illustrate this issue with an automated news recommendation system, and show how the classification algorithms used in such systems can be fooled with hard-to-notice modifications of the articles to classify. We therefore suggest that robustness against adversarial behaviors should be taken into account in the definition of algorithmic accountability, to better capture the risks inherent to algorithmic decision making. We finally discuss the various challenges that this new technical limitation raises for journalism practice. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","2022","2022-03-24 08:56:02","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","67-80","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Descampe202267 tex.affiliation: Research observatory on media & journalism (ORM), Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics (ICTEAM), Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium tex.author_keywords: Accountability; Adversarial machine learning; Algorithms; Computational journalism; Fair machine learning; News recommendation systems; Transparency tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\FF932FX7\Descampe et al. - 2022 - Automated news recommendation in front of adversar.pdf","","enter; Implementation; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current literature offers limited insight into how these technologies reconcile with the shared ideological norms and beliefs of journalists. This article identifies recurring tensions between journalism’s ideology and increasing commercial pressures in existing literature focusing on illustrative examples of digital technology implementations in journalism, and discusses how personalised news recommendation may recreate or mediate these tensions. The findings suggest that personalised news recommendation can facilitate journalism in service of the public by using value-sensitive algorithmic design that incorporates editorial input and nudges users to view diverse and serendipitous content. The findings additionally emphasise the importance of algorithmic transparency as a constituent element to distinguish nudging that prompts reflective behaviour from manipulation of choice, thus mediating tensions with journalism’s ideological aspirations to be fair and objective. Lastly, the paper calls for a higher level of understanding and interaction between journalists and algorithmic designers to mediate the impact on journalistic autonomy and ease the inherent transfer of editorial authority over distribution. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2022","2022-03-24 08:56:04","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Møller2022 tex.affiliation: Department of Media and Journalism Studies, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark; Danish School of Media and Journalism, Aarhus, Denmark tex.author_keywords: Algorithmic journalism; boundary work; journalistic ideals; news diversity; news personalisation; news recommender systems; professional ideology tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\INEAGTUF\Møller - 2022 - Between Personal and Public Interest How Algorith.pdf","","dog; elephant; evil_morty; include; officially_included; sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, they may enable citizens to access a diversity of viewpoints concerning matters of public interest via digital means (“public service recommender systems”). On the basis of Article 10 ECHR, States are arguably required to guarantee such “online access diversity.” At the same time, they must, pursuant to that same provision, at all times ensure that individuals maintain autonomy and freedom of choice as regards whether or not to consume certain content. In that context, this contribution argues that policymakers may consider “nudging” people toward reading diversely through recommendation (libertarian-paternalistic approach). Additionally, it points to the possibility of merely offering users the tools to do so, thereby allowing them to make an (informed) choice as regards whether to use them or not (libertarian approach). The first approach presumably best mitigates chances of selective exposure, whilst the second is more “liberty-preserving.” In either case, States comply with their positive and negative obligations stemming from the freedom to receive information and ideas (without interference by public authority) and the freedom to hold opinions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2022","2022-03-24 08:56:04","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Vermeulen2022 tex.affiliation: Law & Technology, Department of Interdisciplinary Study of Law, Private Law and Business Law, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium tex.author_keywords: Article 10 ECHR; autonomy; freedom of choice; News recommendation; nudging; online access diversity; public service recommender systems; required choice tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\VRDHMWJ2\Vermeulen - 2022 - To Nudge or Not to Nudge News Recommendation as a.pdf","","dog; elephant; evil_morty; include; officially_included; sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current research paradigm, however, holds a narrow (mostly user-centered) perspective on the recommendation task. This makes it difficult to understand that their design is in fact the result of a negotiation process among multiple actors involved, such as editors, business executives, technologists and users. To remedy this, a multi-stakeholder recommendation paradigm has been suggested among recommender systems scholars. This work sets out to explore to what extent this paradigm is applicable to the particular context of news recommenders. We conducted 11 interviews with professionals from three leading media companies in Flanders (Belgium) and find that the development of news recommenders is indeed characterized by a negotiation process among multiple stakeholders. However, our results show that the initial multi-stakeholder framework is not adequately accommodating some of our findings, such as the existence of preconditions, the role of product owners, and the indirect involvement of particular stakeholders. Based on our analysis, we suggest an elaborated framework for multi-stakeholder news recommenders that can contribute to scholarship by providing a multi-sided perspective towards the understanding of news recommenders. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2022","2022-03-24 08:56:04","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Smets2022 tex.affiliation: imec-SMIT, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussel, Belgium tex.author_keywords: Business models; Flanders; interviews; multi-stakeholder recommendation; news recommender; personalization; strategy tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\FAPMVT5W\Smets et al. - 2022 - We’re in This Together A Multi-Stakeholder Approa.pdf","","cat; elephant; include; morty; officially_included; sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research shows that precise modeling of news content and user interests become critical for news rec-ommendation. Existing methods usually utilize information such as news title, abstract, entities to predict Click Through Rate(CTR) or add some auxiliary tasks to a multi-task learning framework. However, none of them directly consider predicted news popularity and the degree of users' attention to popular news into the CTR prediction results. Meanwhile, multiple inter-ests may arise throughout users' browsing history. Thus it is hard to represent user interests via a single user vector. In this paper, we propose PENR, a Popularity-Enhanced News Recommenda-tion method, which integrates popularity prediction task to im-prove the performance of the news encoder. News popularity score is predicted and added to the final CTR, while news popu-larity is utilized to model the degree of users' tendency to follow hot news. Moreover, user interests are modeled from different perspectives via a subspace projection method that assembles the browsing history to multiple subspaces. In this way, we capture users' multi-view interest representations.

However, in some domains the users are not the only stakeholders in the system. For instance, in a news aggregator website users, authors, magazines as well as the platform itself are potential stakeholders. Most of the collaborative filtering recommender systems suffer from popularity bias. Therefore, if the recommender system only considers users’ preferences, presumably it over-represents popular providers and under-represents less popular providers. To address this issue one should consider other stakeholders in the generated ranked lists. In this paper we demonstrate that hypergraph learning has the natural capability of handling a multi-stakeholder recommendation task. A hypergraph can model high order relations between different types of objects and therefore is naturally inclined to generate recommendation lists considering multiple stakeholders. We form the recommendations in time-wise rounds and learn to adapt the weights of stakeholders to increase the coverage of low-covered stakeholders over time. The results show that the proposed approach counters popularity bias and produces fairer recommendations with respect to authors in two news datasets, at a low cost in accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:06","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","5","58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Gharahighehi2021 tex.affiliation: Itec, imec research group at KU Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium; KU Leuven, Campus KULAK, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Kortrijk, Belgium tex.art_number: 102663 tex.author_keywords: Diversity-aware recommender systems; Fair recommender systems; Hypergraph learning; Multi-stakeholder recommender systems; News recommendation tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\Y6WPGRI7\Gharahighehi et al. - 2021 - Fair multi-stakeholder news recommender system wit.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New technologies are coming into the spotlight while potentials for transformation are growing under the surface, leading to the omnipresence of challenges across various fields. Under such circumstances, media and auto companies are both aware of an imminent change. The smart ring developed by our team can be applied to the driver fatigue detection system in industrial production-which helps media companies to access the vehicle networking system by monitoring the fatigue status of drivers, as well as their physiological changes when listening to the news. The vehicle networking system recommends personalized contents for users based on their portraits, using algorithm not only considers their interests and browsing behaviors, but also takes physiological and psychological responses of vehicle users when listening to the news as a key dimension based on the smart ring; therefore, it enables integration of online behavioral and offline physiological data, as such making up for where traditional algorithms fall short. Through intelligent interaction of media contents and human physiological signals, it changes the existing process of news production, manufacturing, distribution, collection, and feedback, and thus will become a model of the future smart recommendation system for in-vehicle infotainment.

This study sheds light on the interplay between content-related (past behavior, habits, preferences) and situational factors (positioning, saturation, control). The latter could offer possibilities to promote more unexpected news encounters that diverge from past news consumption. To test this, a Python-based web application for interactively testing different forms of news personalization over time was used. 247 respondents used the system over a two-week period, in total making almost 23,000 choices. Our results show that: (1) Selections are influenced by a strong positioning effect that follows a reading pattern (left-right, up-down). This effect is stable across devices, topics, and preferences. (2) How much control people are given influences the length and the amount of different sessions (personalization leads to fewer and shorter sessions). (3) With high control, the diversity of preferences influenced the diversity of selected news more, possibly widening gaps between diversity-seeking and -averse users. (4) How often a topic was chosen in the last hour negatively impacts whether it gets chosen again, showing saturation effects. (5) Clicks on sports and economic articles can be explained by preferences, but not past behavior; for political news the opposite is found. (6) There is no significant correlation between the actual diversity (presented or selected topics) and the topic diversity perceived by the users - in spite of clear differences in actual diversity between the groups. From this we can conclude the importance of situational factors in modelling news selection and their potential to narrow or widen the diversity corridor. In sum, our results contribute to a better understanding of the interaction of news recommender systems and humans and how this shapes which news articles get chosen. © 2021 Owner/Author.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:07","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","282-290","","","","","","","ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Loecherbach2021282 tex.affiliation: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Communication Science, Amsterdam, Netherlands; University of Amsterdam, Department of Communication Science, Amsterdam, Netherlands tex.author_keywords: diversity; news recommender systems tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\U3CB4YSM\Loecherbach et al. - 2021 - Is this a click towards diversity Explaining when.pdf","","enter; officially_included; User Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main aim of this study is to propose a framework for ranking online news websites from different viewpoints. The ranking of news websites provides useful information, which can benefit many news-related tasks such as news retrieval and news recommendation. In the proposed framework, the ranking of news websites is obtained by calculating three measures introduced in the article and based on user-generated content (UGC). Each proposed measure is concerned with the performance of news websites from a particular viewpoint including the completeness of news reports, the diversity of events being covered by the website and its speed. The use of UGC in this framework, as a partly unbiased, real-time and low cost content on the web distinguishes the proposed news website ranking framework from the literature. The results obtained for three prominent news websites, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Cable News Network (CNN) and New York Times (NYTimes), show that BBC has the best performance in terms of news completeness and speed, and NYTimes has the best diversity in comparison with the other two websites. © The Author(s) 2020.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:07","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","340-358","","3","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Karimi2021340 tex.affiliation: School of Electrical Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran; School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran; Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, United States; Computer Science Department, University of Houston, United States; Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Iran tex.author_keywords: Classification; event detection; language model; news publisher detection; online news media ranking tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\ZXQXI8LW\Karimi et al. - 2021 - Online news media website ranking using user-gener.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon in the context of political news recommendation algorithms, which have important implications for civil discourse. We first collect and curate a collection of over 900K news articles from 41 sources annotated by topic and partisan lean. We then conduct simulation studies to investigate how different algorithmic strategies affect filter bubble formation. Drawing on Pew studies of political typologies, we identify heterogeneous effects based on the user's pre-existing preferences. For example, we find that i) users with more extreme preferences are shown less diverse content but have higher click-through rates than users with less extreme preferences, ii) content-based and collaborative-filtering recommenders result in markedly different filter bubbles, and iii) when users have divergent views on different topics, recommenders tend to have a homogenization effect.

A table d'hôte (translates as host's table) meal is a sequence of courses that create a balanced and enjoyable dining experience for a guest. Likewise, we believe news RS should strive to create a similar experience for the users by satisfying the news-diet needs of a user. While extant news RS considers criteria such as diversity and serendipity, and RS bundles have been studied for other contexts such as tourism, table d'hôte goes further by ensuring the recommended articles satisfy a diverse set of user needs in the right proportions and in a specific order. In table d'hôte, available articles need to be stratified based on the different ways that news can create value for the reader, building from theories and empirical research in journalism and user engagement. Using theories and empirical research from communication on the uses and gratifications (UG) consumers derive from media, we define two main strata in a table d'hôte news RS, each with its own substrata: 1) surveillance, which consists of information the user needs to know, and 2) serendipity, which are the articles offering unexpected surprises. The diversity of the articles according to the defined strata and the order of the articles within the list of recommendations are also two important aspects of the table d'hôte in order to give the users the most effective reading experience. We propose our vision, link it to the existing concepts in the RS literature, and identify challenges for future research. © 2021 ACM.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:08","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","402-406","","","","","","","The Web Conference 2021 - Companion of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Abdollahpouri2021402 tex.affiliation: Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States tex.author_keywords: balance; diversity; News recommender systems; serendipity tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\GN5Y3QFN\Abdollahpouri et al. - 2021 - Toward the Next Generation of News Recommender Sys.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various recommender systems have been designed to help people discover such information. No matter how accurately the recommender algorithms perform, users' engagement with recommended results has been complained being less than ideal. In this study, we touched on two human-centered objectives for recommender systems: user satisfaction and curiosity, both of which are believed to play roles in maintaining user engagement and sustain such engagement in the long run. Specifically, we leveraged the concept of surprise and used an existing computational model of surprise to identify relevantly surprising health articles aiming at improving user satisfaction and inspiring their curiosity. We designed a user study to first test the validity of the surprise model in a health news recommender system, called LuckyFind. Then user satisfaction and curiosity were evaluated. We find that the computational surprise model helped identify surprising recommendations at little cost of user satisfaction. Users gave higher ratings on interestingness than usefulness for those surprising recommendations. Curiosity was inspired more for those individuals who have a larger capacity to experience curiosity. Over half of the users have changed their preferences after using LuckyFind, either discovering new areas, reinforcing their existing interests, or stopping following those they did not want anymore. The insights of the research will make researchers and practitioners rethink the objectives of today's recommender systems as being more human-centered beyond algorithmic accuracy. © 2021 ACM.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:08","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","163-172","","","","","","","CHIIR 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Niu2021163 tex.affiliation: University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, United States tex.author_keywords: curiosity; recommender systems; surprise; user satisfaction tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\I9VR7CQN\Niu and Al-Doulat - 2021 - LuckyFind Leveraging Surprise to Improve User Sat.pdf","","enter; Implementation; officially_included; User Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recommender systems can make or break filter bubbles, and as such can be instrumental in creating either a more closed or a more open internet. Current approaches to evaluating recommender systems are often focused on measuring an increase in user clicks and short-term engagement, rather than measuring the user's longer term interest in diverse and important information.

Diversity in news media, however, is understood as multiperspectivity (e.g., different opinions on corona measures), and arguably a key responsibility of the press in a democratic society. While viewpoint diversity is often considered synonymous with source diversity in communication science domain, in this paper, we take a computational view. We operationalize the notion of framing, adopted from communication science. We apply this notion to a re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended lists, to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method. Our offline evaluation indicates that the proposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists according to a diversity metric from literature. In an online study, on the Blendle platform, a Dutch news aggregator, with more than 2000 users, we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint diverse news recommendations. We also found that presentation characteristics significantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse recommendations. These results suggest that future research on presentation aspects of recommendations can be just as important as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve multiperspectivity in online news environments. © 2021 Owner/Author.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:08","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","478-488","","","","","","","FAccT 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Mulder2021478 tex.affiliation: Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands; Blendle Utrecht, Netherlands; Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands tex.art_number: 3445911 tex.author_keywords: Framing aspects; Recommender systems; Viewpoint diversity tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\G37DSR7P\Mulder et al. - 2021 - Operationalizing framing to support multiperspecti.pdf","","enter; Implementation; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, the ebbinghaus forgetting curve is used to construct the time-based function and integrate it into the user's interest model for time weighting. On this basis, the adaptive updating strategy of the user's interest model is designed to solve the problem of user's interest variability. Finally, the weighted Jaccard similarity is used to analyze the similarity between users' interest preferences and news text features and generate personalized recommendations.

These challenges emerge from rapidly evolving readers' interests over dynamically generated news items that continuously change over time. News reading is driven by a blend of a reader's long-term and short-term interests. In addition, diversity is required in a news recommender system to keep the reader engaged in the reading process and get them exposed to different views and opinions. This paper proposes a deep neural network that jointly learns news and user representation in a unified framework. It learns the news representation (features) from the headlines, snippets (body) and taxonomy (category, subcategory) of news. The attention mechanism learns a reader's long-term interests from the complete click history, short-term interests from recent clicks via LSTMs and diverse interests. We also apply different levels of attention to our model.

Most previous studies have focused on modeling the relationship between media and stock volatility through advanced algorithms to improve prediction. Only a few studies have attempted to identify and recommend influential media news. Here, we argue that the previous recommendation system is not suitable for this financial scenario in two facts. For one thing, media are distinguished by the meaning they convey, and their value needs to be measured by the quality and comprehensiveness of their content, not by user interest. Second, the recommended media needs to be selected based on the time-sensitive and firm-related characteristics of the stock market. To address these issues, a financial news recommendation system is proposed to accommodate media-aware stock movements. Specifically, a knowledge-aware method is utilized to capture media news containing key content, and a finance-oriented mechanism is further proposed to recommend news articles that incorporate firm relationships and are within their impact time. Experiments performed on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is beneficial for financial news recommendation applications. © 2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:30","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1104-1111","","","2021-December","","","","IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Wang20211104 tex.affiliation: Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China tex.author_keywords: Financial news recommendation; Firm relations; Knowledge-aware; Media-aware; Time sensitive tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\UDH7XGIQ\wang.pdf","","enter; Framework; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To alleviate this problem, news recommendation aims to select news articles for users according to their personal interests. In security applications such as intelligence collection and public opinion monitoring, it is of great importance to obtain valuable information quickly from massive news resources. Different from other application settings, users in security-related scenarios tend to browse news with a domain-oriented purpose. In contrast to the existing news recommendation methods which focus on general-purpose solutions, news recommendation in security applications needs domain-oriented solutions to incorporate users' interests in a specific domain. To this end, in this paper, we propose the problem of domain-oriented news recommendation and develop a specific news recommendation model for security applications. Specifically, our proposed Domain-oriented News Recommendation (DNR) model extracts both general and specific preferences of the user, and performs matching between the user and the candidate news from the above two aspects to combine into the final result.

While social media extensively rely on user data for personalized recommendations, journalistic media may choose to aim to improve the user experience based on textual features such as thematic similarity. From a societal viewpoint, these recommendations should be as diverse as possible. Users, however, tend to prefer recommendations that enable “serendipity”-the perception of an item as a welcome surprise that strikes just the right balance between more similarly useful but still novel content. By conducting a representative online survey with n = 588 respondents, we investigate how users evaluate algorithmic news recommendations (recommendation satisfaction, as well as perceived novelty and unexpectedness) based on different similarity settings and how individual dispositions (news interest, civic information norm, need for cognitive closure, etc.) may affect these evaluations. The core piece of our survey is a self-programmed recommendation system that accesses a database of vectorized news articles. Respondents search for a personally relevant keyword and select a suitable article, after which another article is recommended automatically, at random, using one of three similarity settings. Our findings show that users prefer recommendations of the most similar articles, which are at the same time perceived as novel, but not necessarily unexpected. However, user evaluations will differ depending on personal characteristics such as formal education, the civic information norm, and the need for cognitive closure. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:30","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","208-221","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Wieland2021208 tex.affiliation: Institute of Journalism/Media Research, University of Hamburg, Germany tex.author_keywords: Algorithm-based recommenders; Diversity; News recommender design; Recommender field experiment; Reliable surprise tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\YIV25ZTI\Wieland et al. - 2021 - One recommender fits all An exploration of user s.pdf","","enter; officially_included; User Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, this study focuses on the new dynamics of the ANR and how it potentially influences the newsworkers’ role of gatekeeping within the newsgathering process. Second, this study investigates how the dynamics of an ANR could influence the autonomy of the newsworkers’ role as media agenda setters.

The results show that when newsworkers interact with ANRs, they rely on suggestions and summaries to evaluate what is newsworthy, especially when there is a “news peak” (elections, a worldwide pandemic, etc.).

These (algorithmic) infrastructures influence online news dissemination and therefore necessitate a reconceptualisation of how online media control is or may be exercised in states with restricted media freedom. Indeed, the degree of media plurality and journalistic independence becomes irrelevant when reporting is available but difficult to access; for exam-ple, if the websites of media outlets are not indexed or recommended by the search engines, news aggregators, or social media platforms that function as algorithmic gatekeepers. Research approaches to media control need to be broadened because authoritarian governments are increasingly adopting policies that govern the internet through its infrastructure; the power they leverage against private infrastructure owners yields more effective—and less easily perceptible—control over online content dissemination. Zooming in on the use of trusted notifier-models to counter online harms in Russia, we examine the Netoscope project (a database of Russian domain names suspected of malware, botnet, or phishing activi-ties) in which federal censor Roskomnadzor cooperates with, e.g., Yandex (that downranks listed domains in search results), Kaspersky, and foreign partners. Based on publicly available reports, media coverage, and semi-structured interviews, the article analyses the degree of influence, control, and oversight of Netoscope’s participating partners over the database and its applications.

Using different data sources to predict what content will be interesting for specific readers, recommender systems can better accommodate individual information needs, but also raise concerns about potential audience fragmentation. However, current assessments of the effects of news personalization are predominantly based on observations from Western democracies. This Western-centric approach raises concerns about these assessments’ applicability to other contexts, in particular non-democratic ones, and brings to question the influence of prevalent Western conceptualisations of news personalization (e.g., filter bubbles) on attitudes towards it in non-Western countries. To address this gap, we scrutinize discussions of the promises and threats of news personalization in countries characterized by limited press freedom: Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Using document analysis, we examine how three categories of actors—academics, journalists and IT specialists—discuss news personalization and the ways it can affect the public sphere. Through our analysis we uncover how Western conceptualisations of news personalization interact with discussions about it in non-democratic media systems and scrutinize whether existing concerns about personalization are applicable to non-Western contexts. © 2021 The Author(s).

These methods usually recommend news based on the matching between news content and user interest inferred from historical behaviors. However, these methods usually have difficulties in making accurate recommendations to cold-start users, and tend to recommend similar news with those users have read. In general, popular news usually contain important information and can attract users with different interests. Besides, they are usually diverse in content and topic. Thus, in this paper we propose to incorporate news popularity information to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems for personalized news recommendation. In our method, the ranking score for recommending a candidate news to a target user is the combination of a personalized matching score and a news popularity score. The former is used to capture the personalized user interest in news. The latter is used to measure time-aware popularity of candidate news, which is predicted based on news content, recency, and real-time CTR using a unified framework.

In news websites, most of users are anonymous and the only available data is sequences of items in anonymous sessions. Due to this, typical collaborative filtering methods, which are highly applied in many applications, are not effective in news recommendations. In this context, session-based recommenders are able to recommend next items given the sequence of previous items in the active session. Neighborhood-based session-based recommenders have been shown to be highly effective compared to more sophisticated approaches. In this study, we propose scenarios to make these session-based recommender systems diversity-aware and to address the filter bubble phenomenon. The filter bubble phenomenon is a common concern in news recommendation systems and it occurs when the system narrows the information and deprives users of diverse information. The results of applying the proposed scenarios show that these diversification scenarios improve the diversity measures in these session-based recommender systems based on four news datasets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:31","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Gharahighehi2021 tex.affiliation: Itec, imec Research Group at KU Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium; KU Leuven, Campus KULAK, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Kortrijk, Belgium tex.author_keywords: Diversity; Filter bubble phenomenon; News recommendation; Session-based recommender system tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\FGB5323U\Gharahighehi and Vens - 2021 - Diversification in session-based news recommender .pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The change in the relationship between journalists and the audience caused by the transition to personalized news delivery has profound consequences for the understanding of what journalism should be. To investigate how media practitioners perceive the impact of ANRs on their professional norms and media organizations’ missions, and how these norms and missions can be integrated into ANR design, this article looks at two quality newspapers from the Netherlands and Switzerland. Using an interview-based approach conducted with practitioners in different departments (e.g. journalists, data scientists, and product managers), it explores how ANRs interact with organization-centred and audience-centred journalistic values. The paper’s findings indicate a varying degree of prominence for specific values between individual practitioners in the context of their perception of ANRs. At the same time, the paper also reveals that some organization-centred (e.g. transparency) and most audience-centred (e.g. usability) values are viewed as prerequisites for successful ANR design by practitioners with different professional backgrounds. © 2021 The Author(s).

While AJ has greatly benefited from increasingly sophisticated algorithm technologies, AJ suffers from a lack of transparency and understandability for readers. We identify explainability as a heuristic cue of an algorithm and conceptualizes it in relation to trust by testing how it affects user emotion with AJ. Our experiments show that the addition of interpretable explanations leads to enhanced trust in the context of AJ and readers' trust hinges upon the perceived normative values that are used to assess algorithmic qualities. Explanations of why certain news articles are recommended give users emotional assurance and affirmation. Mediation analyses show that explanatory cues play a mediating role between trust and performance expectancy.

Despite aspirations towards public service algorithms, little is known about which type of news recommender people prefer, let alone about a news recommender that aims to promote societal values. This study aims to give insights into audiences’ perceptions to news recommenders and their underlying news selection mechanisms. To do so, we distinguish between three news selection mechanisms, namely between content-based similarity, collaborative similarity and content-based diversity. The first two strive for similarity, respectively between news content and news users, while the third one aims for diversity in the news content consumed. Results of a large-scale survey (n = 943) show that people prefer content-based similarity over collaborative similarity and content-based diversity. Audience characteristics, such as news information overload and concerns towards missing challenging viewpoints, explain how audiences evaluate the different news selection mechanisms. We discuss how these results align with concerns about selectivity and how news algorithms can be used to tackle these concerns. We therefore introduce the concept ‘personalized diversity’ and promote the idea of news recommenders as an individual filter for the growing abundance of online information. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:31","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","589-618","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Joris2021589 tex.affiliation: imec-mict-UGent, Department of Communication Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Independent Researcher, Ghent, Belgium; Center for Journalism Studies (CJS), Department of Communication Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Research and Development Center for Communication, Media and Design, Artevelde University of Applied Sciences, Ghent, Belgium tex.author_keywords: Algorithmic appreciation; algorithmic perceptions; collaborative similarity; content-based diversity; content-based similarity; news recommenders; news selection; public service algorithms tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\Q39ITIDK\Joris et al. - 2021 - Appreciating News Algorithms Examining Audiences’.pdf","","enter; officially_included; User Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the interactions between algorithms and users from an user-centric perspective, this article explores how young people make sense of, feel about, and engage with algorithmic news curation on social media and when such everyday experiences contribute to their algorithmic literacy. Employing in-depth interviews in combination with the walk-through method and think-aloud protocols with a diverse group of 22 young people aged 16–26 years, it addresses three current methodological challenges to studying algorithmic literacy: first, the lack of an established baseline about how algorithms operate; second, the opacity of algorithms within everyday media use; and third, limitations in technological vocabularies that hinder young people in articulating their algorithmic encounters. It finds that users’ sense-making strategies of algorithms are context-specific, triggered by expectancy violations and explicit personalization cues. However, young people’s intuitive and experience-based insights into news personalization do not automatically enable young people to verbalize these, nor does having knowledge about algorithms necessarily stimulate users to intervene in algorithmic decisions. © The Author(s) 2021.","2021","2022-03-24 08:56:32","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Swart2021 tex.affiliation: University of Groningen, Netherlands tex.author_keywords: algorithm awareness; algorithmic literacy; audience studies; experience; news literacy; news personalization; news use; tactics of news use tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\32I3VKCN\Swart - 2021 - Experiencing Algorithms How Young People Understa.pdf","","enter; Interview; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent times, unhealthy outcomes from these systems have been highlighted including their vulnerability to amplifying small differences and offering less choice to readers. In this paper we present and study a new class of feedback models that exhibit a variety of self-organizing behaviors. In addition to showing important emergent properties, our model generalizes the popular “top-N news recommender systems” in a manner that provides media managers a mechanism to guide the emergent outcomes to mitigate potentially unhealthy outcomes driven by the self-organizing dynamics. We use complex adaptive systems framework to model the popularity evolution of news articles. In particular, we use agent-based simulation to model a reader's behavior at the microscopic level and study the impact of various simulation hyperparameters on overall emergent phenomena. This simulation exercise enables us to show how the feedback model can be used as an alternative recommender to conventional top-N systems. Finally, we present a design framework for multi-objective evolutionary optimization that enables recommendation systems to co-evolve with the changing online news readership landscape. © 2021 Prawesh, Padmanabhan.

The diversity of the recommended results has received much less attention in this field.

In this work, we propose a latent factor model to achieve the requisite level of accuracy while maintaining a reasonable level of diversity in a news recommender system. The existing latent factor methods mostly rely on Tikhonov regularization to improve the generality of the learnt models. These methods tend to focus mainly on accuracy measures, i.e., generating recommendations highly aligned with a user's past preference, which may cause a decrease in the diversity of information to which news readers are exposed. In our work, we make effective use of elastic-net regression to regularize the model for both the accuracy and the diversity in a single optimization framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over the state-of-the-art methods by conducting extensive experiments on a real-world news dataset. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-03-24 08:56:32","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","551-560","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Raza2020551 tex.affiliation: Ryerson University, Department of Computer Science, Toronto, Canada tex.art_number: 9378340 tex.author_keywords: Accuracy; Diversity; Latent factors; News Recommender; Optimization; Regularization; User-item Interactions tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\FBEWAMCV\raza.pdf","","coffee; elephant; enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the vast amount of research devoting to design new algorithms to improve the performance of recommendation systems, the evaluation mostly focuses on recommendation quality. Little attention is paid to the social impact of recommendation systems. On the other hand, it is noted in the literature that the users of recommendation systems suffer from 'partial information blindness', i.e. only exposed to the like-minded content information cocoon or filter bubble. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an impact evaluation framework of recommendation systems, comprising of five constructs, namely, diversity, objectivity, information cocoon, affect cocoon, and intentionality. The evaluation is conducted in a 'black-box' way based on the empirical interaction data between the recommender and its individual users. To enable the individual level evaluation, we propose a lightweight agent-based simulation to collect individual's interaction data with recommenders in the complex real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with a case study in Toutiao and Baidu News, which are the top two news aggregator apps in China. The results show that both applications demonstrate a periodic information cocoon of about 7-day time interval, the news recommended through these two apps bear distinct differences: Toutiao has better captured the user's reading preference and the quality of the recommended articles, while Baidu News demonstrate a higher affect cocoon and intentionality in the recommended articles, with average perceived difficulty of the recommended articles 2.9% higher than Toutiao, and average perceived persuasiveness 9.6% higher than Toutiao. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-03-24 08:56:32","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","893-900","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology, WI-IAT 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Zhao2020893 tex.affiliation: CN-CERT, Beijing, China; Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia tex.art_number: 9457817 tex.author_keywords: Evaluation framework; Personalized recommendation; Social impact tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\2V56D7QA\Zhao et al. - 2020 - An impact evaluation framework of personalized new.pdf","","enter; fox; Maybe; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to fill this theoretical gap by testing a three-way interaction effect among news valence, identity desirability, and uniqueness on attitude toward the news story. Through a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment, it is shown that a positive news story tends to generate a more favorable attitude when matched to the reader’s desired self-identity, whereas a negative news story will generate a more favorable attitude when matched to the person’s undesired self-identity, and such an effect is especially pronounced when the identity is unique.

We conducted four focus groups with online news readers in Germany. For the analysis, grounded theory techniques were suitable due to their applicability in reconstructing user perspectives through their own experiences. We found that (1) users fail to distinguish between news personalisation and commercial targeting, which may negatively bias their perception; (2) there is a contradiction in how users perceive themselves as active participants in the process, but lack the means to exercise agency; (3) user concerns extend beyond privacy to what information they receive and their right to personal autonomy—a solution requires offering users the ability to dynamically adjust their “news interest profiles”; (4) while news personalisation strategies afford new opportunities for introducing reciprocity in the media-audience relationship, negotiating competing logics of journalistic, personal and algorithmic curation remains a challenge. © 2020 The Author(s).

We show how elites? reactions to design probes could be rooted into party ideologies. Based on these, we discuss directions how social media services could be designed. Our underlying contribution is wider. We show how studying elites can provide insights about politics embedded into proposed novel social media services for political engagement. Second, we demonstrate what elites? perspective provide fruitful way to expand and rethink concepts that have been used to study ordinary people before. Finally, we discuss potential challenges of replacing economic interests with political interest in social media service design and provide a richer account on the discussion about social media regulation. Therefore, we pave the way to more research to critically study elites within social computing scholarship and highlight the importance of understanding political motivations which can guide the development of social media. © 2020 ACM.","2020","2022-03-24 08:56:32","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","CSCW2","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Grön2020 tex.affiliation: University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Aalto University, Espoo, Finland tex.art_number: 104 tex.author_keywords: democracy; news recommendations systems; political elites; political parties; political polarization; studying up tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\SARIEU8P\Grön and Nelimarkka - 2020 - Party Politics, Values and the Design of Social Me.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vectorial features modern systems extract from the plain text of news articles are already highly predictive of the associated news outlet. We propose a new training scheme based on adversarial machine learning to tackle this issue .

Recommendation algorithms are an effective way to solve this problem. At present, a large number of recommended algorithms adopt the following two ideas: content-based text similarity algorithm and user-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Researchers have developed a distributed collaborative recommendation protocol based on blockchain. However, these algorithms ignore the characteristics of the news industry itself. Just adopting the above ideas will inevitably lead to many internet public opinion problems. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved N-TF-IDF algorithm, which is more suitable for the news industry, and can control the outbreak of negative public opinion, and has a positive effect on stabilizing internet public opinion. Through the verification of the experimental data set, the algorithm is superior to the traditional information retrieval and text mining technology TF-IDF in both the time dimension and the emotional dimension, and this algorithm is not affected by citizens' privacy rights. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-03-24 08:56:33","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","132-136","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2020 3rd International Conference on Smart BlockChain, SmartBlock 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Gao2020132 tex.affiliation: Henan International Joint Laboratory of Theories, Key Technologies on Intelligence Networks Henan University, Kaifeng, China; Educational Information Technology Laboratory, Henan University, Kaifeng, China; Vocational and Technical College, Art Department Yellow River Water Conservancy, Henan, China; Texas Am University-Commerce Commerce, Department of Computer ScienceTX 75428, United States; College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310027, China tex.art_number: 9415685 tex.author_keywords: Blockchain; Collaborative Filtering Algorithm; Information Overload; Privacy-Preserving; Recommendation Algorithm; TF-IDF tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\9B2RVU7H\Gao et al. - 2020 - An Improved News Recommendation Algorithm Based on.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ambiguity is even more troubling in news recommendation algorithms, where thorny issues are complicated. This study investigates the user experience and usability of algorithms by focusing on users' cognitive process to understand how qualities/features are received and transformed into experiences and interaction. This work examines how users perceive and feel about issues in news recommendations and how they interact and engage with algorithm-recommended news. It proposes an algorithm experience model of news recommendation integrating the heuristic process of cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors. The underlying algorithm can affect in different ways the user's perception and trust of the system. The heuristic affect occurs when users' subjective feelings about transparency and accuracy act as a mental shortcut: users considered transparent and accurate systems convenient and useful. The mediating role of trust suggests that establishing algorithmic trust between users and NRS could enhance algorithm performance. The model illustrates the users' cognitive processes of perceptual judgment as well as the motivation behind user behaviors. The results highlight a link between news recommendation systems and user interaction, providing a clearer conceptualization of user-centered development and the evaluation of algorithm-based services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2022-03-24 08:56:34","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Shin2020 tex.affiliation: College of Communication and Media Sciences, Zayed University, P.O.

Existing news recommendation methods rely on centralized storage of user behavior data for model training, which may lead to privacy concerns and risks due to the privacy-sensitive nature of user behaviors. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving method for news recommendation model training based on federated learning, where the user behavior data is locally stored on user devices. Our method can leverage the useful information in the behaviors of massive number users to train accurate news recommendation models and meanwhile remove the need of centralized storage of them. More specifically, on each user device we keep a local copy of the news recommendation model, and compute gradients of the local model based on the user behaviors in this device. The local gradients from a group of randomly selected users are uploaded to server, which are further aggregated to update the global model in the server. Since the model gradients may contain some implicit private information, we apply local differential privacy (LDP) to them before uploading for better privacy protection. The updated global model is then distributed to each user device for local model update. We repeat this process for multiple rounds. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our method in news recommendation model training with privacy protection. ©2020 Association for Computational Linguistics","2020","2022-03-24 08:56:37","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1423-1432","","","","","","","Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics Findings of ACL: EMNLP 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Qi20201423 tex.affiliation: Department of Electronic Engineering and BNRist, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, 100080, China tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\H2XKH8EX\Qi et al. - 2020 - Privacy-preserving news recommendation model learn.pdf","","coffee; elephant; enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In news websites most of users are anonymous and the only available data is sequences of items in anonymous sessions. Due to this, typical collaborative filtering methods, which are highly applied in many applications, are not effective in news recommendations. In this context, session-based recommenders are able to recommend next items given the sequence of previous items in the active session. Session-based k nearest neighbor method has been shown to be highly effective compared to more sophisticated approaches. In this study we propose three scenarios to make session-based k nearest neighbor method diversity-aware and to address the filter bubble phenomenon. The filter bubble phenomenon is a common concern in recommendation systems and it occurs when the system narrows the information and deprives users of diverse information. The results of applying proposed scenarios show that these diversification scenarios improve the rank and relevance sensitive diversity measure in session-based k nearest neighbor method based on three news datasets. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Existing news recommendation methods usually infer user interest from click behaviors on news. However, users may click a news article because attracted by its title shown on the news website homepage, but may not be satisfied with its content after reading. In many cases users close the news page quickly after click. In this paper we propose to model user interest from both click behaviors on news titles and reading behaviors on news content for news recommendation. More specifically, we propose a personalized reading speed metric to measure users' satisfaction with news content. We learn embeddings of users from the news content they have read and their satisfaction with these news to model their interest in news content. In addition, we also learn another user embedding from the news titles they have clicked to model their preference in news titles. We combine both kinds of user embeddings into a unified user representation for news recommendation. We train the user representation model using two supervised learning tasks built from user behaviors, i.e., news title based click prediction and news content based satisfaction prediction, to encourage our model to recommend the news articles which not only are likely to be clicked but also have the content satisfied by the user.

As a specific application domain, news recommender systems aim to give the most relevant news article recommendations to users according to their personal interests and preferences. Recently, a family of models has emerged that aims to improve recommendations by adapting to the contextual situation of users. These models provide the premise of being more accurate as they are tailored to satisfy the continuously changing needs of users. However, little attention has been paid to the emotional context and its potential on improving the accuracy of news recommendations. The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether, how and to what extent emotion features can improve recommendations. Towards that end, we derive a large number of emotion features that can be attributed to both items and users in the domain of news. Then, we devise state-of-the-art emotion-aware recommendation models by systematically leveraging these features. We conducted a thorough experimental evaluation on a real dataset coming from news domain. Our results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art non-emotion-based recommendation models. Our study provides evidence of the usefulness of the emotion features at large, as well as the feasibility of our approach on incorporating them to existing models to improve recommendations.

For example, unlike in other domains, the relevance of news articles drops significantly over time, and the order in which users visit news articles matters greatly. Furthermore, in the context of breaking news, user interests can change rapidly, and there is a need to generate recommendations on-the-fly, taking into account recently published articles and the latest trends among users’ preferences. To address these issues, we use a form of sequential pattern mining to generate up-to-date news recommendations on a click-by-click basis. In this approach, patterns are mined incrementally from the incoming clickstream so that new items and trends are considered. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method compares favorably with existing techniques and outperforms them on a variety of metrics.

However, the highly volatile nature of the news content and the dynamic and evolving user preferences are either ignored or not taken into full consideration in these systems. In a news recommender system, it is very likely that a user's short-term interest or preference may have a sudden change due to an emerging social or personal event or breaking news while their long-term interests may change gradually or remain. For these long-term interests of the readers, it is often more appropriate to associate them with news categories than with individual news items. In this paper, we propose a biased matrix factorization model with consideration of both temporal dynamics of user preferences and news taxonomy to build a news recommender system. By conducting an extensive experiment on a collection of news data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model against traditional matrix factorization models as well as other neural recommender baselines. The findings from our experiments show that news category is an important factor when readers choose news articles to read, and temporal factors with consideration of different temporal resolution also play a role in this process. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-03-24 08:56:41","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","920-929","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Raza2019920 tex.affiliation: Ryerson University, Department of Computer Science, Toronto, Canada tex.art_number: 9005459 tex.author_keywords: Biases; Categories; Latent factors; Matrix factorization; News recommendations; Taxonomy; Temporal dynamics; Temporal effects tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\32ULWQC4\Raza and Ding - 2019 - News Recommender System Considering Temporal Dynam.pdf","","coffee; elephant; enter; officially_included; timeliness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The news is filled with noise as well as irrelevant media that may not be considered valuable. In addition, it is vital to prioritize this data post the filtering process due to the possibility of information overload. This can be attained by ranking the information by making use of three major factors. The first factor is the media focus (MF) of any topic in the news which describes its temporal prevalence in the news. The second factor is the user attention (UA) which indicates its temporal prevalence in social network media. The last factor is known as user interaction (UI) which depicts the various interactions amongst all the users who are currently discussing this topic.

In this paper, we focus on the case of non-personalized news recommender systems, and explore persuasive techniques that can, nonetheless, be used to enhance recommendation presentation, with the aim of capturing the user's interest on suggested items leveraging the way news is perceived. We present the results of two evaluations ""in the wild"", carried out in the context of a real online magazine and based on data from 16,134 and 20,933 user sessions, respectively, where we empirically assessed the effectiveness of persuasion strategies which exploit logical fallacies and other techniques. Logical fallacies are inferential schemes known since antiquity that, even if formally invalid, appear as plausible and are therefore psychologically persuasive. In particular, our evaluations allowed us to compare three persuasive scenarios based on the Argumentum Ad Populum fallacy, on a modified version of the Argumentum ad Populum fallacy (Group-Ad Populum), and on no fallacy (neutral condition), respectively. Moreover, we studied the effects of the Accent Fallacy (in its visual variant), and of positive vs. negative Framing. © 2019 by the authors.","2019","2022-03-24 08:56:41","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Gena2019 tex.affiliation: Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Torino, Turin, 10149, Italy; ICAR-CNR Institute, Palermo, 90146, Italy tex.art_number: 300 tex.author_keywords: Evaluation in the wild; Fallacies; Framing; Non-personalized recommender systems; persuasive technologies tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\EBDX4L2L\Gena et al. - 2019 - When personalization is not an option An in-the-w.pdf","","enter; fox; implicit value (what needs to be read); Maybe; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to a large number of stories being published in these media sites, users usually rely on news recommendation systems to find important news. In this work, we focus on automatically recommending news stories to all users of such media websites, where the selection is not influenced by a particular user’s news reading habit. When recommending news stories in such non-personalized manner, there are three basic metrics of interest—recency, importance (analogous to relevance in personalized recommendation) and diversity of the recommended news. Ideally, recommender systems should recommend the most important stories soon after they are published. However, the importance of a story only becomes evident as the story ages, thereby creating a tension between recency and importance. A systematic analysis of popular recommendation strategies in use today reveals that they lead to poor trade-offs between recency and importance in practice. So, in this paper, we propose a new recommendation strategy (called Highest Future-Impact) which attempts to optimize on both the axes. To implement our proposed strategy in practice, we propose two approaches to predict the future-impact of news stories, by using crowd-sourced popularity signals and by observing editorial selection in past news data. Finally, we propose approaches to inculcate diversity in recommended news which can maintain a balanced proportion of news from different news sections. Evaluations over real-world news datasets show that our implementations achieve good performance in recommending news stories. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2022-03-24 08:56:41","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","447-475","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Chakraborty2019447 tex.affiliation: Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Saarbrücken, Germany; Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India tex.author_keywords: Coverage bias; News recommendation; Recency-relevance trade-off; Recommendation diversity tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\SEUX9G35\Chakraborty et al. - 2019 - Optimizing the recency-relevance-diversity trade-o.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The news business is undergoing rapid transformations regarding how news production is financed, how news is produced and delivered to audiences and how citizens consume news. In all of these changes algorithmic recommender systems play a role. We focus on news organizations’ own personalized news services, and analyze how they define the role of personalization in contributing to the financial success of the organization, in reaching and retaining audiences, and in fulfilling their editorial mission. We interviewed editors, journalists, technologists and business intelligence and publishing professionals to gain a structural understanding of the often conflicting goals of personalization. We found that rather than focusing on increasing short-term user engagement, European quality news media try to use news personalization to increase long-term audience loyalty.

We focus and elaborate on the concept of user control because that mitigates multiple problems at once. Taking the news industry as our domain, we conducted four focus groups, or moderated think-aloud sessions, with Dutch news readers (N=21) to systematically study how people evaluate diferent control mechanisms (at the input, process, and output phase) in a News Recommender Prototype (NRP). While these mechanisms are sometimes met with distrust about the actual control they ofer, we found that an intelligible user profle (including reading history and fexible preferences settings), coupled with possibilities to infuence the recommendation algorithms is highly valued, especially when these control mechanisms can be operated in relation to achieving personal goals.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a critical review of existing research on peace journalism and algorithmic news personalization, and analyzes the intersections between the two concepts. Specifically, it identifies recurring pitfalls of peace journalism based on empirical research on constructive conflict coverage and then introduces a conceptual framework for analyzing to what degree these pitfalls can be mediated – or worsened – through algorithmic system design. Findings: The findings suggest that AI-driven distribution technologies can facilitate constructive war reporting, in particular by countering the effects of journalists’ self-censorship and by diversifying conflict coverage. The implementation of these goals, however, depends on multiple system design solutions, thus resonating with current calls for more responsible and value-sensitive algorithmic design in the domain of news media. Additionally, our observations emphasize the importance of developing new algorithmic literacies among journalists both to realize the positive potential of AI for promoting peace and to increase the awareness of possible negative impacts of new systems of content distribution. Originality/value: The article particle is the first to provide a comprehensive conceptualization of the impact of new content distribution techniques on constructive conflict coverage in the context of peace journalism.

Intuitively, these negative experiences will affect users' behaviors and satisfaction, but such effects have not been well understood. In this work, a retrospective analysis is conducted using real users' log data, containing user's explicit feedback of negative experiences, from a commercial news streaming application. Through multiple intra-session comparison experiments, we find that in current session, users will spend less time reading the content, lose activeness and leave sooner after having negative experiences. Later return and significant changes of user behaviors in the next session are also observed, which demonstrates the existence of inter-session effects of negative experiences. Since users' negative experiences are generally implicit, we further investigate the possibility and the approach to automatically identify them. Results show that using changes of both users' intra-session and inter-session behaviors achieves significant improvement. Besides the effects on user behaviors, we also explore the effects on user satisfaction by incorporating a laboratory user study. Results show that negative experiences reduce user satisfaction in the current session, and the impact will last to the next session.

Typically, recommendations are based on past user interactions (e.g., movies a user saw, hotels a user booked, etc.). This work in progress paper focuses on news recommender systems. Because of the nature of news (e.g., constantly new items, short item lifetime, etc.), recommendations based on past interactions are especially hard to make. Hence, news recommender systems heavily rely on the actual content of news. While previous work mainly considers one aspect of the content of news articles, we jointly analyse and discuss in this work a given corpora of news articles on three different levels (i.e., document-level, topic-level, and author-level). The overall aim is to set to provide the basis for a comprehensive news recommender system, which reaches beyond accuracy and considers also diversity and serendipity. We demonstrate that relevant information can be extracted out of a given corpora, and differences in author, time, and topic can be shown. Furthermore, the author-level analysis shows that documents can be clustered based on the writing style of authors. Finally, our findings show that author-level analysis has the potential to recommend the most diverse items compared to the other approaches. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-03-24 08:56:43","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","405-413","","","1","","","","Proceedings - 21st IEEE Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Sertkan2019405 tex.affiliation: Research Unit of E-Commerce, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria tex.art_number: 8808047 tex.author_keywords: Co-occurence Networks; Online News; Recommender Systems; Text Mining; Topic Modelling tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\B3HVQQ62\065001a405.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We utilized a between-subjects design. The Facebook account of each participant (N=217) was analyzed. Based on this analysis, our participants were shown a fictitious Facebook post that was presumably shared by one of their Facebook friends with whom they had either a strong social tie (experiment group), or a weak social tie (control group). All recipients were then asked about their perceptions regarding the news source (from which the item presumably originated), and their perception regarding the credibility of the presented item. Our findings indicate that the strength of the social tie between the sharer of the item and its recipient mediates the effect of the credibility perception regarding the news source, and the perceived item credibility, as well as the likelihood of searching for additional information regarding the topic presented in the shared item. © ISSN.","2019","2022-03-24 08:56:43","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","71-80","","60","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Samuel-Azran201971 tex.affiliation: Sammy Ofer School of Communications, Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzliya, Israel tex.author_keywords: Credibility; Experiment; Influence; Information search; News consumption; Quantitative analysis; Social network analysis; Social networking sites tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\8AZY6KP6\Samuel-Azran and Hayat - 2019 - Online news recommendations credibility The tie i.pdf","","credibility; discuss; enter; Facebook; Maybe; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human emotions are widely regarded as important predictors of behavior and preference. They are a crucial factor in decision making, but until recently, relatively little has been known about the effectiveness of using human emotions in personalizing real-world recommender systems. In this paper we introduce the Emotion Aware Recommender System (EARS), a large scale system for recommending news items using user’s self-assessed emotional reactions. Our original contribution includes the formulation of a multi-dimensional model of emotions for news item recommendations, introduction of affective item features that can be used to describe recommended items, construction of affective similarity measures, and validation of the EARS on a large corpus of real-world Web traffic. We collect over 13,000,000 page views from 2,700,000 unique users of two news sites and we gather over 160,000 emotional reactions to 85,000 news articles. We discover that incorporating pleasant emotions into collaborative filtering recommendations consistently outperforms all other algorithms. We also find that targeting recommendations by selected emotional reactions presents a promising direction for further research. As an additional contribution we share our experiences in designing and developing a real-world emotion-based recommendation engine, pointing to various challenges posed by the practical aspects of deploying emotion-based recommenders. © 2018, The Author(s).","2019","2022-03-24 08:56:44","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","345-379","","2","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Mizgajski2019345 tex.affiliation: AppliedIntelligence.pl, Libelta 34/1, Poznan, 61-707, Poland; CAMIL: Center for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Faculty of Computing, Poznan University of Technology, Piotrowo 2, Poznan, 60-965, Poland tex.author_keywords: Affective computing; Emotion analysis; Emotion mining; News recommendations; Recommender systems tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\83DJK7NM\Mizgajski and Morzy - 2019 - Affective recommender systems in online news indus.pdf","","enter; Maybe; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current solutions focus on top down, server based approaches to decide whether a news article is fake or biased, and display only trusted news to the end users. In this paper, we follow a different approach to help the users make informed choices about which news they want to read, making users aware in real time of the bias in news articles they were browsing and recommending news articles from other sources on the same topic with different levels of bias. We use a recent Pew research report to collect news sources that readers with varying political inclinations prefer to read. We then scrape news articles on a variety of topics from these varied news sources. After this, we perform clustering to find similar topics of the articles, as well as calculate a bias score for each article. For a news article the user is currently reading, we display the bias score and also display other articles on the same topic, out of the previously collected articles, from different news sources. This we present to the user. This approach, we hope, would make it possible for users to access more balanced articles on given news topics.

We show that the value of personalization depends on commonly overlooked factors, such as concerns about a shared news sphere, and the depth and diversity of recommendations. However, these expectations are not universal. Younger, less educated users have little exposure to non-personalized news, and they also show little concern about diverse news recommendations. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. We show that quality news organizations that pursue reader loyalty and trust have a strong incentive to implement personalization algorithms that help them achieve these particular goals by taking into account diversity expecting user attitudes and providing high quality recommendations. Diversity-valuing news readers are thus well placed to be served by diversity-enhancing recommender algorithms. However, some users are in danger of being left out of this positive feedback loop. We make specific policy suggestions regarding how to address the issue of diversity-reducing feedback loops, and encourage the development of diversity-enhancing ones. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user’s access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user’s behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA’s utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour. We discuss some of the ethical, social and legal implications of this technology and argue that it can sometimes exploit and reinforce weaknesses in human beings. © 2018, The Author(s).","2018","2022-03-24 08:56:47","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","735-774","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Burr2018735 tex.affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, Merchant Venturers Building, Woodland Road, Bristol, BS8 1UB, United Kingdom; Department of Philosophy, Cotham House, University of Bristol, Bristol, BS6 6JL, United Kingdom tex.author_keywords: Artificial intelligence; Autonomy; Human–computer interaction; Machine learning; Nudge; Persuasion tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\KZ9I9ZV6\Burr et al. - 2018 - An Analysis of the Interaction Between Intelligent.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we focus on the news industry, where different algorithms are used to customize news offerings to increasingly specific audience preferences. While this personalization of news enables media organizations to be more receptive to their audience, it can be questioned whether current deployments of algorithmic news recommenders (ANR) live up to their emancipatory promise. Like in various other domains, people have little knowledge of what personal data is used and how such algorithmic curation comes about, let alone that they have any concrete ways to influence these data-driven processes. Instead of going down the intricate avenue of trying to make ANR more transparent, we explore in this article ways to give people more influence over the information news recommendation algorithms provide by thinking about and enabling possibilities to express voice. After differentiating four ideal typical modalities of expressing voice (alternation, awareness, adjustment and obfuscation) which are illustrated with currently existing empirical examples, we present and argue for algorithmic recommender personae as a way for people to take more control over the algorithms that curate people's news provision.

Many sources for latest news are available on the web, and individuals can make use of their favorite news source to get the daily news, but most of the time they are unable to get the news of desired interest. There is a need to analyze the news and rank them according to user's interest. Social media can provide an insight on a user's likes and dislikes, which used for news recommendation. This paper presents a multi-agent framework [1] that uses a novel methodology for ranking news articles on the basis of user's interests fetched from social media [2]. To do so, we have modeled the relationship between user's social media preferences and news categories: we have extracted categories from social media, mapped with general news categories. Our developed solution provides 28% better results than current news websites recommendation. Further experimentations show that our solution provides effective news recommendation as it makes use of the user's social media profile [3], which always updated and maintained by the user firsthand. Another important objective is to increase positivity in one's life. These days the world is in turmoil due to terrorism activities [4].These activities naturally attract media coverage, presenting an unpleasant view of various regions of the world. Although there are many good things/activities happening around us, we mostly see violence and hate speech everywhere on the web [5]. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to extract the impact of the statement i.e. weather the statement is positive or negative [6], [7], and [8]. Sentiment analysis used to filter news based on harmful negative activities and displaying positive news of latest inventions in world, advancement in the industry, relief packages from governments and other growth opportunities. Based on these ideas, we have developed an android application and performed a pilot study. Our results show higher satisfaction levels for users when searching news articles through the proposed system. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-03-24 08:56:47","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","","","","","2018 International Conference on Smart Computing and Electronic Enterprise, ICSCEE 2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Ashraf2018 tex.affiliation: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea; University of Malaya, Kuala Limphur, Malaysia; National Univeristy of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan tex.art_number: 8538403 tex.author_keywords: Human Computer Interaction; Information retrieval; Recommendation System; Sentimental Analysis; Social Media tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\XVUIVCI3\Ashraf et al. - 2018 - Personalized News Recommendation based on Multi-ag.pdf","","enter; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of News Recommender Systems (NRS) is to make reading suggestions to users in a personalized way. Due to their practical relevance, a variety of technical approaches to build such systems have been proposed over the last two decades. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of designing and evaluating news recommender systems over the last ten years. One main goal of the work is to analyze which particular challenges of news recommendation (e.g., short item life times and recency aspects) have been well explored and which areas still require more work.

The advent of personalized news recommendations has completely changed this simpler news landscape. Such recommendations effectively produce numerous personalized editions of a single newspaper, consisting of only the stories recommended to a particular reader. Although prior works have considered news coverage of different newspapers, due to the difficulty of knowing what news is recommended to whom, there has been no prior study to look into the coverage of information in different personalized news editions. Moreover, the evolution of the effects of personalization on recommended news stories is also not explored. In this work, we make the first attempt to investigate these issues. By collecting extensive data from New York Times personalized recommendations, we compare the information coverage in different personalized editions and investigate how they evolve over time. We observe that the coverage of news stories recommended to different readers are considerably different, and these differences further change with time.

We hypothesize that users will be surprised when presented with information that violates the expectations predicted by our model of them.

Typically, modeling temporal behavior increases the cost of parameter inference and estimation.

Therefore, it is often difficult to model temporal behavior in large-scale real-world recommendation systems. In this work, we propose a deep neural network architecture which is based on a two level approach. We first generate document embeddings for every news article. We then use these embeddings and the previously read articles by a user to come up with her user profile. We then use this profile along with adequate positive and negative samples in order to train our model. The resulting model is then applied to a real-world data set. We compare it with a set of established baselines and the experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art. We also use the learned model to recommend articles to users who have had very little interaction with items, i.e., have read a very less amount of news articles.

A recommendation system would help to tackle such a problem. However, due to the lack of sufficient amount of data, most of the state-of-the-art methods perform poorly in terms of recommending relevant news items to the users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for Item-based Collaborative filtering for recommending news items using Markov Decision Process (MDP). Due to the sequential nature of news reading, we choose MDP to model our recommendation system as it is based on a sequence optimization paradigm. Further, we also incorporate factors like article freshness and similarity into our system by extrinsically modelling it in terms of reward for the MDP. We compare it with various other state-of-the-art methods. On a moderately low amount of data we see that our MDP-based approach outperforms the other approaches. One of the reasons for this is that the baselines fail to identify the underlying patterns within the sequence in which the articles are read by the users. Hence, the baselines are not able to generalize well. © 2017 IEEE.","2017","2022-03-24 08:56:51","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","757-760","","","2017-November","","","","IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Khattar2017757 tex.affiliation: Information Retrieval and Extraction Laboratory, International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500032, India tex.author_keywords: Collaborative Filtering; Markov Decision Process; News Recommendation; Semantic Similarity tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\BPULIXXZ\Khattar et al. - 2017 - Leveraging moderate user data for news recommendat.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; manually added document; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A bandit-based solution is formulated to balance three competing factors during online learning, including exploitation for immediate click, exploitation for expected future clicks, and exploration of unknowns for model estimation. We rigorously prove that with a high probability our proposed solution achieves a sublinear upper regret bound in maximizing cumulative clicks from a population of users in a given period of time, while a linear regret is inevitable if a user's temporal return behavior is not considered when making the recommendations. Extensive experimentation on both simulations and a large-scale real-world dataset collected from Yahoo frontpage news recommendation log verified the effectiveness and significant improvement of our proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art online learning baselines for recommendation. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To keep users always active and interested, media platforms need an effective recommender system to bring up new articles that match user interests. In this article, we show that we can improve the quality of recommendation by exploiting valuable information provided by user comments. This information reveals aspects not directly tackled by the news article on which they have been posted. We call such aspects latent aspects. We demonstrate how these latent aspects can make a crucial difference in the accuracy of future recommendation. The challenge in detecting them is due to the noisy nature of user comments. To support our claim, we propose a novel news recommendation system that (1) enriches the description of news articles by latent aspects extracted from user comments, (2) deals with noisy comments by proposing a model for user comments ranking, and (3) proposes a diversification model to remove redundancies and provide a wide coverage of aspects. We have tested our approach using large collections of real user activities in four news Web sites, namely The INDEPENDENT, The Telegraph, CNN and Al-Jazeera. The results show that our approach outperforms baseline approaches achieving a significantly higher accuracy. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2017","2022-03-24 08:56:51","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1293-1312","","6","20","","World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Meguebli20171293 tex.affiliation: Orange Labs – France Telecom, 4 rue du Clos Courtel, Rennes, France; Free University of Bozen-Bolzan, Piazza Domenicani 3, Bozen-Bolzano, 39100, Italy; LRI – CentraleSupélec, Saclay, 91405, France tex.author_keywords: Diversification; News recommendation; User comments ranking tex.document_type: Article tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\4KXP89QP\Meguebli et al. - 2017 - Towards better news article recommendation With t.pdf","","fish; hope; include; maybe; morty; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We extend existing research on the dynamics of news reading behavior by focusing both on the progress of reading interests over time and their relations. Reading interests are considered in three levels: short-, medium-, and long-term. Combinations of these are evaluated in terms of added value to the recommendation's performance and ensured news variety. Experiments with 17-month worth of logs from a German news publisher show that most frequent relations between news reading interests are constant in time but their probabilities change.

However, providing interesting news for each user is a challenging task in highly-dynamic news domain. Many news aggregator sites such as Google News suggest its users to provide sign in to the system for getting user-specific (relevant) news articles. For more generic news recommendation, the system collects user click history and page access pattern implicitly. Often the users are not sure about the usage of the collected and consolidated data by the recommender systems which they usually trade for receiving the news recommendation.

While ID-based methods, such as collaborative filtering and low-rank factorization, are well known for making recommendations, they are not suitable for news recommendations because candidate articles expire quickly and are replaced with new ones within short spans of time. Word-based methods, which are often used in information retrieval setings, are good candidates in terms of system performance but have issues such as their ability to cope with synonyms and orthographical variants and define ""queries"" from users' historical activities. This paper proposes an embedding-based method to use distributed representations in a three step end-to-end manner: (i) start with distributed representations of articles based on a variant of a denoising autoencoder, (ii) generate user representations by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with browsing histories as input sequences, and (iii) match and list articles for users based on inner-product operations by taking system performance into consideration. The proposed method performed well in an experimental offline evaluation using past access data on Yahoo! JAPAN's homepage. We implemented it on our actual news distribution system based on these experimental results and compared its online performance with a method that was conventionally incorporated into the system. As a result, the click-through rate (CTR) improved by 23% and the total duration improved by 10%, compared with the conventionally incorporated method. Services that incorporated the method we propose are already open to all users and provide recommendations to over ten million individual users per day who make billions of accesses per month. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","2017","2022-03-24 08:56:52","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1933-1942","","","Part F129685","","","","Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: Okura20171933 tex.affiliation: Yahoo Japan Corporation, Tokyo, Japan tex.author_keywords: Distributed representations; Large-scale services; Neural networks; News recommendations tex.document_type: Conference Paper tex.source: Scopus","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\MQUYBQ9S\Okura et al. - 2017 - Embedding-based news recommendation for millions o.pdf","","cat; include; morty; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effectiveness of news recommendation systems reduces due to lack of user ratings and automated novelty detection. A progressive summary helps a user to monitor changes in news items over a period of time.

To this aim, a signal processing technique (i.e., the discrete wavelet transform) is adopted to represent and analyze such signals. Furthermore, we report the experimental results of a very preliminary comparative evaluation on an online available dataset. Such results seem encouraging, thus spurring us to continue developing our approach.","2016","2022-03-24 08:58:03","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","1618","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\RLHYNQ7M\Caldarelli et al. - 2016 - A signal-based approach to news recommendation.pdf","","dog; include; officially_included; rick","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most current news recommender systems use time as a decaying factor in ratings or just cut off older articles according to some simple mechanism. An experiment done on four different newspapers in Norway reveal that the time issue is somewhat more complicated. The life span of articles varies substantially from one newspaper to another, and from one category to another.

User fatigue represents the phenomenon that a user quickly loses the interest on the recommended item if the same item has been presented to this user multiple times before. The direct impact caused by the user fatigue is the dramatic decrease of the Click Through Rate (CTR, i.e., the ratio of clicks to impressions). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the research of the user fatigue in online recommender systems. By analyzing user behavioral logs from Bing Now news recommendation, we find that user fatigue is a severe problem that greatly affects the user experience. We also notice that different users engage differently with repeated recommendations. Depending on the previous users' interaction with repeated recommendations, we illustrate that under certain condition the previously seen items should be demoted, while some other times they should be promoted. We demonstrate how statistics about the analysis of the user fatigue can be incorporated into ranking algorithms for personalized recommendations. Our experimental results indicate that significant gains can be achieved by introducing features that reflect users' interaction with previously seen recommendations (up to 15% enhancement on all users and 34% improvement on heavy users).","2016","2022-03-24 08:58:03","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1363-1372","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\43T55XFV\Ma et al. - 2016 - User fatigue in online news recommendation.pdf","","cat; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the popularity of the Internet and social media, users are constantly provided, or even bombarded, with the latest news around the world. With numerous sources of news, it has become a real challenge for users to follow the news that they are interested. Previous work used user profile to recommend personalized news; and used RSS feeds and latest tweets to provide popular, trendy news. In this work we combine these two methods with three enhancements. First, to personalize news recommendation we used a hybrid approach, which involved the analyses of click through, user tweets, and user Twitter friends list to build user profile, this method significantly improves the accuracy of user profile. Second, to address the importance of temporal dynamics, we add a unique new feature of location preference to the news recommendation system. Third, we allow users to choose the ratio of popular news vs. trendy news they desire. The resulting system is then evaluated based on user satisfaction and accuracy. The results show that the average user satisfaction increases from 8.6 to 9.4 when location preference is added, while the accuracy of the recommendation system is around 92-95%. We believe that the proposed system is a successful example of incorporating temporal dynamics to recommendation systems; the combination of using hybrid user profile, popularity, trends and location would have significant impact on other recommendation systems in the future. © 2016 IEEE.","2016","2022-03-24 08:58:03","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","204-211","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\BQ7RCFVJ\Natarajan and Moh - 2016 - Recommending news based on hybrid user profile, po.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; manually added document; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The speed at which news reaches the reader notwithstanding, the proliferation of blogs and microblogs to deliver specialized content has become the order of the day. Even highly engaged users tend to disengage with a website when the content they are served is unappealing to them. While recommendation systems have been used to ensure delivery of content to the user in tune with their tastes, these systems face an unprecedented challenge - the transient nature of 'popular' news and users' changing interests. Moreover, the challenge is compounded by the absence of explicit feedback. Most recommendation systems for recommending digital news content rely on inferring user engagement through 'clicks', which is not necessarily an accurate measure as it gives us no explicit information about the degree to which a user is interested in a news article. In this paper, we introduce and study the behavior of temporal and tag-based models for news article recommendation. Our experiments indicate that incorporating temporal and taginformation improves recommendation quality and increases user engagement. We argue through experimental evaluation that the improved performance is due to recommendation of more personalized news content by the tag-based recommendation algorithms as compared to other models that do not explicitly incorporate user-tag information. © 2015 IEEE.","2016","2022-03-24 08:58:03","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","689-696","","","2016-January","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\WZTZ47JY\Muralidhar et al. - 2016 - Recommending temporally relevant news content from.pdf","","cat; evil_morty; include; manually added document; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The added value of contextual information for the recommendation process is highly dependent on the application domain, the type of contextual information, and variations in users’ usage behavior in different contextual situations. This paper investigates whether users utilize a mobile news service in different contextual situations and whether the context has an influence on their consumption behavior. Furthermore, the importance of context for the recommendation process is investigated by comparing the user satisfaction with recommendations based on an explicit static profile, content-based recommendations using the actual user behavior but ignoring the context, and context-aware content-based recommendations incorporating user behavior as well as context. Considering the recommendations based on the static profile as a reference condition, the results indicate a significant improvement for recommendations that are based on the actual user behavior. This improvement is due to the discrepancy between explicitly stated preferences (initial profile) and the actual consumption behavior of the user. The context-aware content-based recommendations did not significantly outperform the content-based recommendations in our user study.

Yet several key issues still remain unresolved, including optimal handling of cold starts and how best to maintain user- privacy within that context. Recent work has demonstrated a potentially fruitful line of attack in the form of cross- system user modelling, which uses features generated from one domain to bootstrap recommendations in another. In this paper we evidence the effectiveness of this approach through direct real-world user feedback, deconstructing a cross-system news recommendation service where user models are generated via social media data. It is shown that even when a relatively naive vector-space approach is used, it is possible to automatically generate user-models that provide statistically superior performance than when items are explicitly filtered based on a user's self-declared preferences. Detailed qualitative analysis of why such effects occur indicate that different models are capturing widely different areas within a user's preference space, and that hybrid models represent fertile ground for future research. © 2016 ACM.","2016","2022-03-24 08:58:02","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","183-188","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\6KD5B8EH\Alanazi et al_2016_Cross-system recommendation.pdf","","dog; include; maybe; officially_included; rick","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, many research efforts have been put on location-aware news recommendation, which recommends to users news happening nearest to them. Nevertheless, in a real-world context, users' news preferences are not only related to their locations, but also strongly related to their personal interests. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid method called location-aware personalized news recommendation with explicit semantic analysis (LP-ESA), which recommends news using both the users' personal interests and their geographical contexts. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in LP-ESA suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the performance of LP-ESA. To address these problems, we further propose a novel method called LP-DSA to exploit recommendation-oriented deep neural networks to extract dense, abstract, low dimensional, and effective feature representations for users, news, and locations. Experimental results show that LP-ESA and LP-DSA both significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, LP-DSA offers more effective (19.8%-179.6% better) online news recommendation with much lower time cost (25 times quicker) than LP-ESA. © 2013 IEEE.","2017","2022-03-24 08:58:02","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1624-1638","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\77LJ6E3K\Chen et al_2017_Location-aware personalized news recommendation with deep semantic analysis.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a news recommendation system which combines content-based and georeferenced techniques in a mobility scenario, is proposed. Taking into account the volatility of the information, short-Term and long-Term user profiles are considered and implicitly built. Besides tracking users' clicks, the system infers different levels of interest an article has by tracking and weighting each action in the system and in social networks. Impact of the different fields that make up a news is also taken into account by following the inverted pyramid model that assumes different levels of importance to each paragraph of the article.

As a response, we propose a solution called neighborhood-based transfer learning (NTL) for this new problem. Specifically, in order to address the new user cold-start challenge, we propose a cross-domain preference assumption, i.e., users with similar app-installation behaviors are likely to have similar tastes in news articles, and then transfer the knowledge of neighborhood of the coldstart users from an APP domain to a news domain. For the new item cold-start challenge, we design a category-level preference to replace the traditional item-level preference because the latter is not applicable for the new items in our problem. We then conduct empirical studies on a real industry data with both users' app-installation behaviors and news-reading behaviors, and find that our NTL is able to deliver the news articles more accurately than other methods on different ranking-oriented evaluation metrics. © 2017 Copyright is held by the author(s).","2017","2022-03-24 08:58:02","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","38-41","","","1887","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\HZMKXGT6\Liu et al. - 2017 - Transfer learning from APP domain to news domain f.pdf","","cat; include; morty; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The selection of ‘front-page’ stories on these media sites usually takes into consideration several crowdsourced popularity metrics, such as number of views or shares by the readers. In this work, we focus on automatically recommending front-page stories in such media websites. When recommending news stories, there are two basic metrics of interest – recency and relevancy. Ideally, recommender systems should recommend the most relevant stories soon after they are published. However, the relevancy of a story only becomes evident as the story ages, thereby creating a tension between recency and relevancy. A systematic analysis of popular recommendation strategies in use today reveals that they lead to poor trade-offs between recency and relevancy in practice. So, in this paper, we propose a new recommendation strategy (called Highest Future-Impact) which attempts to optimize on both the axes. To implement our proposed strategy in practice, we develop an optimization framework combining the predicted future-impact of the stories with the uncertainties in the predictions. Evaluations over three real-world news datasets show that our implementation achieves good performance trade-offs between recency and relevancy. © 2017 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)","2017","2022-03-24 08:58:01","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","837-846","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\RPNP43QM\Chakraborty et al_2017_Optimizing the recency-relevancy trade-off in online news recommendations.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem is that they extract a steep cost in terms of privacy. The service providers collect and analyze user's personal data to provide the service, but can infer sensitive information about the user in the process. In this work we ask the question ""How can we provide personalized news recommendation without sharing sensitive data with the provider?"" We propose a local private intelligence assistance framework (PrIA), which collects user data and builds a profile about the user and provides recommendations, all on the user's personal device. It decouples aggregation and personalization: it uses the existing aggregation services on the cloud to obtain candidate articles but makes the personalized recommendations locally. Our proof-of-concept implementation and small scale user study shows the feasibility of a local news recommendation system. In building a private profile, PrIA avoids sharing sensitive information with the cloud-based recommendation service. However, the trade-off is that unlike cloud-based services, PrIA cannot leverage collective knowledge from large number of users. We quantify this trade-off by comparing PrIA with Google's cloud-based recommendation service. We find that the average precision of PrIA's recommendation is only 14% lower than that of Google's service. Rather than choose between privacy or personalization, this result motivates further study of systems that can provide both with acceptable trade-offs. © 2017 ACM.","2017","2022-03-24 08:58:01","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","91-96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\87RW9973\Jain et al. - 2017 - PrIA A private intelligent assistant.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In public search engines, the objects of search terms reflect the issues that interest or concern search engine users. Because of the popularity of search engines, search indexes have become a new measure for describing public interest trends. With the help of a public search index provided by search engines, we construct a news topic search feature and a news object search feature. These features measure the public attention on key elements of the news. In the experiment, we compare various feature models with machine learning algorithms with respect to financial news recommendations.

The proposed method, a topic model based on LDA, represents the user preference with not only the news articles read by user but the locations of the user. By representing the user preference differently over her location, it suggests the news articles which are appropriate the user location. In the evaluation of the proposed method compared to the LDA, it outperforms in topic quality both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. In addition, the experimental result on news article recommendation shows that the location based user preference improves the performance of news article recommendation. © 2014 IEEE.","2014","2022-03-24 08:58:06","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","99-104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\FMC74HMB\Noh et al. - 2014 - A location-based personalized news recommendation.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the news domain it is difficult to extract explicit signals from the users about their interests, and user profiling depends on in-depth analyses of users' reading habits. This is a challenging task, as news articles have short life spans, are unstructured, and make use of unclear and rapidly changing terminologies.

The method includes the multi-dimensional similarity calculation, the Jaccard-Kmeans fast clustering and the Top-N recommendation. The multi-dimensional similarity calculation method is used to compute the integrated similarity between users, which considers abundant content feature of news, behaviors of users, and the time of these behaviors occurring. Based on traditional K-means algorithm, the Jaccard-Kmeans fast clustering method is proposed. This clustering method first computes the above multi-dimensional similarity, then generates multiple cluster centers with user behavior feature and news content feature, and evaluates the clustering results according to cohesiveness. The Top-N recommendation method integrates a time factor into the final recommendation. Experiment results prove that the proposed method can enhance the scalability of news recommendation, significantly improve the recommendation accuracy in condition of data sparsity, and improve the timeliness of news recommendation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There are several algorithms that can be used to generate news recommendations, and the strategies for manipulation resistance are likely specific to the algorithm (or class of algorithm) used. In this paper, we will focus on a common method used on the front page by many media sites of recommending the N most popular articles (e.g., New York Times, BBC, CNN, Wall Street Journal all prominently use this). We show that whereas recommendation of the N most read articles is easily susceptible to manipulation, a probabilistic variant is more robust to common manipulation strategies. Furthermore, for the ""N most popular"" recommender, probabilistic selection has other desirable properties. Specifically, the 4N C15th article, which may have just missed making the cut-off, is unduly penalized under common user models. Small differences are easily amplified initially, an observation that can be used by manipulators. Probabilistic selection, on the other hand, creates no such artificial penalty.

A critical challenge is how to model emotions with respect to time spans. To this end, we propose a time-aware topic modeling perspective for solving this problem. Specifically, we first develop a model named emotion-Topic over Time (eToT), in which we represent the topics of news as a Beta distribution over time and a multinomial distribution over emotions. Whilee ToT can uncover the latent relationship among news, emotion and time directly, it cannot capture the dynamics of topics. Therefore, we further develop another model named emotion based Dynamic Topic Model (eDTM), where we explore the state space model for tracking the dynamics of topics. In addition, we demonstrate that both eToT and eDTM could enable several potential applications, such as emotion prediction, emotion-based news recommendations and emotion anomaly detections. Finally, we validate the proposed models with extensive experiments with a real-world data set. © 2014 IEEE.","2014","2022-03-24 08:58:05","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","697-706","","","2015-January","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Issue: January","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\KQT34EXL\Zhu et al_2014_Tracking the Evolution of Social Emotions.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the recommender algorithms should work efficiently: On the one hand, news recommendations must be provided within milliseconds since the recommendations must be embedded in news article pages.

However, if a news recommender shows to the user many news articles that cover same story or talk about same persons or events, then the recommendations might become monotonous for the user. A possible way to handle this scenario is to diversify the recommended news articles so that the articles in the recommendation list are not too similar to each other. Existing research works in literature discuss how to use user-specific relevance of news articles and diversification to produce the final recommendations. To be able to compute user-specific relevance of articles, several recommender systems suggest that users have a login, or they set cookies to track page visits of the users. Often users are unsure whether the information collected via these means will be used for the sole purpose of news recommendation. Privacy of the identity and page access patterns is a concern for many users. In this work, we consider the problem where diverse recommendations are to be given for users, but no past data about users is collected or stored by the system. We use only article popularity to estimate the relevance. We identify few aspects of news articles on which diversification can be performed. These aspects are incorporated in an optimization framework. An approximation algorithm is used to generate the recommendations. Experimental analysis shows that in scenarios where no individual user data is stored or accessible by the recommender system, diversification results in higher click rates and increase in the number of satisfied users. Performances of the multiple diversification aspects and approaches are also analyzed. © 2014 IEEE.","2014","2022-03-24 08:58:05","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","135-141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\JYGU79NA\Desarkar and Shinde - 2014 - Diversification in news recommendation for privacy.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; manually added document; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional user profiling techniques often construct profiles of users based on static historical data accessed by users. However, due to the frequent updating of news repository, it is possible that a user's fine-grained reading preference would evolve over time while his/her long-term interest remains stable. Therefore, it is imperative to reason on such preference evaluation for user profiling in news recommenders. Besides, in content-based news recommenders, a user's preference tends to be stable due to the mechanism of selecting similar content-wise news articles with respect to the user's profile. To activate users' reading motivations, a successful recommender needs to introduce ""somewhat novel"" articles to users. In this paper, we initially provide an experimental study on the evolution of user interests in real-world news recommender systems, and then propose a novel recommendation approach, in which the long-term and short-term reading preferences of users are seamlessly integrated when recommending news items. Given a hierarchy of newly-published news articles, news groups that a user might prefer are differentiated using the long-term profile, and then in each selected news group, a list of news items are chosen as the recommended candidates based on the short-term user profile. We further propose to select news items from the user-item affinity graph using absorbing random walk model to increase the diversity of the recommended news list.

Scholars have worried that proliferation of personalization technologies will degrade public opinion by isolating people from challenging perspectives. Informed by selective exposure research, this study examines personalized news recommender system designs using a communication mediation model. Recommender system design choices examined include computer-generated personalized recommendations, user-customized recommendations, and full or limited news information environments based on recommendations. Results from an online mock election experiment with Ohio adult Internet users indicate increased selective exposure when using personalized news systems. However, portals recommending news based on explicit user customization result in significantly higher counterattitudinal news exposure. Expected positive effects on elaboration and indirect effects on knowledge through elaboration are found only in personalized news recommender systems that display only recommended headlines. Lastly, personalized news recommender system use has a negative direct effect on knowledge. © The Author(s) 2013.","2014","2022-03-24 08:58:05","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","1019-1041","","8","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\LXB89AE6\Beam - 2014 - Automating the News How Personalized News Recomme.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increasing use of hand-held devices, the interests of users are not influenced only by news contents, but also by their location. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel topic model to incorporate user location into a user preference for the location-based personalized news recommendation. The proposed model is Spatial Topical Preference Model (STPM). By representing the preference of a user differently according to the location of the user, the model recommends the user appropriate news articles to the user location. For this purpose, we represent geographical topic patterns with a Gaussian distribution. STPM is trained only with the news articles that the user actually reads. As a result, it shows poor performance, when the user reads just a few news articles. This problem of STPM is compensated for by LDA-based user profile that is not affected by user location. Therefore, the final proposed model is a combined model of STPM and LDA. In the evaluation of the proposed model, it is shown that STPM reflects user locations into news article recommendation well, and the combined model outperforms both STPM and LDA. These experimental results prove that the location-based user preference improves the performance of news article recommendation, and the proposed model incorporates the locational information of users into news recommendation effectively. © 2015 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","2015","2022-03-24 08:58:05","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","439-449","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\JHITPH8U\Yoon et al. - 2015 - A personalized news recommendation using user loca.pdf","","dog; include; morty; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the recommendation process of news articles, personalization and analysis of news content plays an important role. But beyond recommending the articles itself, we think that where the news come from is also very important. Different news sources have their own style, view and way of expression and they may give the user a complete, balanced and wide perspective of news stories.

Dynamic user profiling considers changing user interests. Collaborative filtering approach captures user's behaviour in relationship with other similar users. Providing news about the city that the user is currently stationed will also improve the relevancy of the news. Including news based on the sentiments of the people in the current location is also considered. This paper proposes a news recommendation framework based on four personalisation attributes, namely, user profile, group interest, location and sentiments. The weight age of these attributes is not the same for all users. Hence genetic algorithm is used to identify the weight age of the attributes and personalise it for a particular user. The major issue with the personalized news recommendation system is scalability. This paper addresses the issue using Hbase, a column family database on hadoop framework.

We propose a simple, efficient, and provably near-optimal approach to optimizing such prediction problems based on noregret learning. Our method leverages a surprising result from online submodular optimization: a single no-regret online learner can compete with an optimal sequence of predictions. Compared to previous work, which either learn a sequence of classifiers or rely on stronger assumptions such as realizability, we ensure both data-efficiency as well as performance guarantees in the fully agnostic setting. Experiments validate the efficiency and applicability of the approach on a wide range of problems including manipulator trajectory optimization, news recommendation and document summarization.

In the proposed framework, users can express explicit trust statements on news reports, news sources and other users.

This is particularly significant in the industries that offer digital contents to their clients, such as consulting and news services. Due to the digital nature of their products, fully customized services over the Internet is possible. To customize services, however, a company needs to well understand its customers and consequently provide tailored product/services based on their preference. In this paper, a news recommendation system that allows a news service provider to analyze its customer profile and then produce customized news services is developed. The method determines customer interests from the structure of the news read by a client and the reading time. Once customer profile is constructed, personal news services can be provided by the system. An empirical study using actual news provided by the China Times shows that the recommendation system outperforms the traditional headline news compiled by the news editor in both objective performance indices and customer satisfaction. In addition to news services, this approach can be generalized to other industries and services whose products can be digitized, such as consulting and knowledge management.","2003","2022-03-24 08:58:10","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","225-229","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\8B6TKVRR\Lai et al. - 2003 - Customized Internet News Services Based on Custome.pdf","","elephant; evil_morty; fish; include; officially_included; sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on only interesting topics enables iScore to discard useless profiles to address changes in user interests and to achieve a balance between resource consumption and classification accuracy. Also by relating a topic's interestingness to an article.s interestingness, iScore is able to achieve higher quality results than traditional methods such as the Rocchio algorithm. We identify several operating parameters that work well for MTT. Using the same parameters, we show that MTT alone yields high quality results for recommending interesting articles from several corpora. The inclusion of MTT improves iScore's performance by 9% in recommending news articles from the Yahoo! News RSS feeds and the TREC11 adaptive filter article collection.

Also we have also shon that online parameter learning can yield 10% better results than best performing filter from the TREC11 adaptive filter task.

In this paper, we propose a scalable two-stage personalized news recommendation approach with a two-level representation, which considers the exclusive characteristics (e.g., news content, access patterns, named entities, popularity and recency) of news items when performing recommendation. Also, a principled framework for news selection based on the intrinsic property of user interest is presented, with a good balance between the novelty and diversity of the recommended result.

A general framework, called iScore, is presented for defining and measuring the ""interestingness"" of articles, incorporating user-feedback. iScore addresses the various aspects of what makes an article interesting, such as topic relevance, uniqueness, freshness, source reputation, and writing style. It employs various methods, such as multiple topic tracking, online parameter selection, language models, clustering, sentiment analysis, and phrase extraction to measure these features. Due to varying reasons that users hold about why an article is interesting, an online feature selection method in naïve Bayes is also used to improve recommendation results. iScore can outperform traditional IR techniques by as much as 50.7%. iScore and its components are evaluated in the news recommendation task using three datasets from Yahoo!

Recently, a ""semantic approach"" to news recommendation has become popular. Semantic news recommendation normally relies upon a manually constructed domain Ontology and a user profile. The current semantic news recommenders have their flaws: 1. constructing and maintaining a manual Ontology is a manually intensive and laborious task, 2. user profiles may inhibit the selection of novel, but interesting stories which are atypical of the user's previous selections and 3. the current approach semantic approaches ignores the ""importance"" of a story to the monitored domain. This paper describes Magellan (Magalhães), a semantic recommendation system which ranks ""breaking financial news"" by their ""importance"" to a monitored domain. In addition Magellan uses an automatically constructed and maintained adaptive Ontology which autonomously discovers new relations and entities whist removing outdated or erroneous information. Magellan applies a ""temporal confidence"" to each relation and once a relation's ""temporal confidence"" falls below a preassigned constant it is removed. The ranking of stories is with a ""weighted term frequency"" (WTF) scheme. The domain Ontology is used to identify relevant terms in candidate stories. A term's weight is determined by its: 1. Centrality and 2. Prestige (which incorporates a relation's temporal confidence). An evaluation of Magellan with an inverted index and a semantic news recommender system with a static Ontology demonstrated a clear advantage for Magellan. © 2011 AISTI.","2011","2022-03-24 08:58:08","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\7MDVQIDJ\Drury et al. - 2011 - Magellan An adaptive ontology driven breaking fi.pdf","","dog; evil_morty; include; manually added document; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we study the problem of post-click news recommendation. Given that a user has perused a current news article, our idea is to automatically identify ""related"" news articles which the user would like to read afterwards. Specifically, we propose to characterize relatedness between news articles across four aspects: relevance, novelty, connection clarity, and transition smoothness. Motivated by this understanding, we define a set of features to capture each of these aspects and put forward a learning approach to model relatedness. In order to quantitatively evaluate our proposed measures and learn a unified relatedness function, we construct a large test collection based on a four-month commercial news corpus with editorial judgments. The experimental results show that the proposed heuristics can indeed capture relatedness, and that the learned unified relatedness function works quite effectively.

Identification of topical patterns is critical in this task. Common strategies in the previous studies rely on news entities to extract topic patterns. In such a way, news is recommended solely based on the author's point of view. In this article, we argue that, in social media, the performance of recommendation can be immensely enhanced if user interaction is better utilized. It overcomes the bias of traditional news recommendation by suggesting relevant information with a balanced perspective of authors and readers. This is achieved by identifying and using the topic patterns of the original news posting and its comments, one of the most useful records of user behaviors in social media. In particular, to capture the dynamic concerns of users, hidden topic patterns are extracted by utilizing both textual and structural information of comments. To do so, we model the relationship among comments and that relative to the original posting using an undirected acyclic graph, where each node is a word; each edge is a structural link between words.

This common recommendation process is known to have major limitations in terms of creating artificial amplification in the counts of recommended articles and that it is easily susceptible to manipulation. To address these issues, probabilistic NRS has been introduced. One drawback of the probabilistic recommendations is that it potentially chooses articles to recommend that might not be in the current ""best"" list. However, the probabilistic selection of news articles is highly robust towards common manipulation strategies. This paper compares the two variants of NRS (Top-N and probabilistic) based on (1) accuracy loss (2) distortion in counts of articles due to NRS and (3) comparison of probabilistic NRS with an adapted influence limiter heuristic. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","2012","2022-03-24 08:58:08","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","183-189","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\RSCM4YBM\Prawesh and Padmanabhan - 2012 - Analysis of probabilistic news recommender systems.pdf","","evil_morty; fish; include; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As there is much real-time social information in there, they are candidates to be used as a source for mining important information enhancing user experience in variety of web applications, especially those related with content adaptation and recommendation. In this paper we deal with microblog-based user models. We propose trend-aware user model with location-aware trends, which focuses on location aspects and trends. It is a general model, which can be used in various domains. We evaluated the model in a domain of news recommendations and we showed that recommendation based on this model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. © 2012 IEEE.","2012","2022-03-24 08:58:08","2022-04-13 16:38:21","","23-28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\CGWY9DFT\Kanta et al. - 2012 - Trend-aware user modeling with location-aware tren.pdf","","cat; evil_morty; include; manually added document; officially_included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review methods for analyzing novelty and then describe Newsjunkie, a system that personalizes news for users by identifying the novelty of stories in the context of stories they have already reviewed. Newsjunkie employs novelty-analysis algorithms that represent articles as words and named entities. The algorithms analyze inter-andintra-document dynamics by considering how information evolves over timefrom article to article, as well as within individual articles. We review the results of a user study undertaken to gauge the value of the approachover legacy time-based review of newsfeeds, and also to compare the performance of alternate distance metrics that are used to estimate the dissimilarity between candidate new articles and sets of previously reviewed articles.","2004","2022-04-12 08:16:31","2022-04-13 16:38:21","2022-04-12","482–490","","","","","","Newsjunkie","WWW '04","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\ohund\Zotero\storage\4II4PQ5D\Gabrilovich et al. - 2004 - Newsjunkie providing personalized newsfeeds via a.pdf","","include; officially_included; post-search-finding","news; novelty detection; personalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
