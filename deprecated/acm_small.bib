abstract = {News article recommendation differs in several ways from other well-known types of recommender systems such as for music and movies. First, freshness represents an important aspect. Sometimes, freshness is deemed more important than relevancy. Second, similarity between news articles does not necessarily reflect their relatedness. For instance, two news articles might share a majority of words. Still, their actual topic might differ. Third, news are typically published in a rather unstructured format. In contrast, structured data such as social graphs facilitate pre-processing steps. Fourth, news readers might have special preferences on some particular events which recommender systems can barely predict. Fifth, serendipities (i. e., variety in recommended news articles) represent a crucial property of a news recommender system. Contrarily to music recommendations, users avoid to re-consume an item. Thus, news recommender systems are required to provide diverse sets of items in order to assure not to recommend monotonously. Sixth, breaking or trendy news might have a high relevance even though the appear completely unrelated to the individual user profile. Seventh, the has not yet established consensus on how to evaluate news recommender systems. We typically observe implicit preferences as users interact with news portals. Those preferences do not exhibit a graded relevance. Thus, well-established evaluation criteria based on ratings (e.g., root mean squared error) cannot be applied. Another set of challenges arises from the context of news recommendation. Recommender systems are known to struggle with so-called "cold-start users" (i. e., users form whom no preferences are available yet). News portals typically refrain to require users to login prior to read news articles. Hence, there is a large fraction of users who appear to be "cold-start users". The lack of sufficiently many interaction to established trustworthy user profiles entails further challenges. Inferring interest signals suffers from incomplete profiles. Additionally, items' relevance is time dependent and diminishes with time progressing. Another challenge related to the context arises from the increasingly frequent use of mobile devices to read news articles such as tablets and smart phones. Those have a limited space available to display news and related recommendations. News recommender systems have to deal with this issue thus applying suited layout mechanisms to fit the content to the available screen. Finally, news recommender systems face numerous technical challenges. Those challenges include minimizing response time improve user experience, scaling to the large amount of requests to avoid time outs, providing flexibility to incorporate new recommendation methods or adjust parameter settings for existing implementations, and guarantee a reliable service whom user can access at any time.},

abstract = {In prior work we addressed a major problem faced by media sites with popularity based recommender systems such as the top-10 list of most liked or most clicked posts. We showed that the hard cutoff used in these systems to generate the "Top N"lists is prone to unduly penalizing good articles that may have just missed the cutoff. A solution to this was to generate recommendations probabilistically, which is an approach that has been shown to be robust against some manipulation techniques as well. The aim of this research is to introduce a class of probabilistic news recommender systems that incorporates widely practiced recommendation techniques as a special case. We establish our results in a special case of two articles using the urn models with feedback mechanism from probability theory.},

abstract = {The broad motivation for our research is to build manipulation resistant news recommender systems. However, there can be several different algorithms that are used to generate news recommendations, and the strategies for manipulation resistance are likely specific to the algorithm (or class of algorithm) employed. In this paper we will focus on a common method used by many media sites of recommending the N most read (or popular) articles (e.g. New York Times, BBC, Wall Street Journal all prominently use this). Through simulation results we show that whereas recommendation of the N most read articles is easily susceptible to manipulation, a simple probabilistic variant is more robust to common manipulation strategies. Further, for the "N most read" recommender, probabilistic selection has other desirable properties. Specifically, the (N+1)th article, which may have "just" missed making the cutoff, is unduly penalized under common user models. Small differences initially are easily amplified -- an observation that can be used by manipulators. Probabilistic selection, on the other hand, creates no such artificial penalty. We also use classical results from urn models to derive theoretical results for special cases.},

abstract = {With the increasing ubiquity of access to online news sources, the news recommender systems are becoming widely popular in recent days. However, providing interesting news for each user is a challenging task in highly-dynamic news domain. Many news aggregator sites such as Google News suggest its users to provide sign in to the system for getting user-specific (relevant) news articles. For more generic news recommendation, the system collects user click history and page access pattern implicitly. Often the users are not sure about the usage of the collected and consolidated data by the recommender systems which they usually trade for receiving the news recommendation. Privacy of user identity, user behavior in terms of page access patterns contributes to the overall privacy risks in the news domain. This review paper discusses the current state-of-the-art of privacy risks and existing privacy preserving approaches in the news domain from user perspective.},

abstract = {Media monitoring services allow their customers, mostly companies, to receive, on a daily basis, a list of documents from mass media that discuss topics relevant to the company. However, media monitoring services often generate these lists by using keyword-filtering techniques, which introduce many false positives. Hence, before the end users, i.e., the employees of the company, may consult these lists and find relevant documents, a human editor must inspect the keyword-filtered documents and remove the false positives. This is a time consuming job. In this paper we present a recommender system that aims at reducing the number of documents that the editor needs to inspect every day. The proposed solution classifies documents (represented with TF-IDF and embeddings features) using techniques trained on data containing the editors’ past actions (i.e. the removals of false positives). The proposed technique is shown to be able to correctly predict the true positives, thus reducing the number of documents that the editor needs to inspect every day.},

abstract = { This paper proposes a vision and research agenda for the next generation of news recommender systems (RS), called the table d’h\^{o}te approach. A table d’h\^{o}te (translates as host’s table) meal is a sequence of courses that create a balanced and enjoyable dining experience for a guest. Likewise, we believe news RS should strive to create a similar experience for the users by satisfying the news-diet needs of a user. While extant news RS considers criteria such as diversity and serendipity, and RS bundles have been studied for other contexts such as tourism, table d’h\^{o}te goes further by ensuring the recommended articles satisfy a diverse set of user needs in the right proportions and in a specific order. In table d’h\^{o}te, available articles need to be stratified based on the different ways that news can create value for the reader, building from theories and empirical research in journalism and user engagement. Using theories and empirical research from communication on the uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) consumers derive from media, we define two main strata in a table d’h\^{o}te news RS, each with its own substrata: 1) surveillance, which consists of information the user needs to know, and 2) serendipity, which are the articles offering unexpected surprises. The diversity of the articles according to the defined strata and the order of the articles within the list of recommendations are also two important aspects of the table d’h\^{o}te in order to give the users the most effective reading experience. We propose our vision, link it to the existing concepts in the RS literature, and identify challenges for future research.},

This motivates us to research methods facilitating the inclusion of context and trends into news recommender systems. We explain specific requirements for news recommender system and discuss approaches incorporating trends and temporal user habits in order to improve news recommender system. A detailed data analysis motivates our approach. In addition, we discuss experiences of applying news recommendation algorithms online. The evaluation shows that approaches come with specific strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, publishers should select the recommendation strategy with the specific requirements in mind.},

In this paper, we first introduced some basic knowledge and the development trend of the recommender systems. Then we illustrate an improved similarity algorithm in news recommender system to make sure the algorithm pay more attention to users' interest. The algorithm will modify their weight through users' action. In the experiment, we use the AJS AWC-BC and AK-Means algorithms in real news recommender system and compared with some other algorithm.

abstract = {News articles are increasingly consumed digitally and recommender systems (RS) are widely used to personalize news feeds for their users. Thereby, particular concerns about possible biases arise. When RS filter news articles opaquely, they might "trap" their users in filter bubbles. Additionally, user preferences change frequently in the domain of news, which is challenging for automated RS. We argue that both issues can be mitigated by depicting an interactive version of the user's preference profile inside an overview of the entire domain of news articles. To this end, we introduce NewsViz, a RS that visualizes the domain space of online news as treemap, which can interactively be manipulated to personalize a feed of suggested news articles. In a user study (N=63), we compared NewsViz to an interface based on sliders. While both prototypes yielded high results in terms of transparency, recommendation quality and user satisfaction, NewsViz outperformed its counterpart in the perceived degree of control. Structural equation modeling allows us to further uncover hitherto underestimated influences between quality aspects of RS. For instance, we found that the degree of overview of the item domain influenced the perceived quality of recommendations.},

In this paper, we combine the text and image in a given user's browsing news article and classify the article through deep neural network, then we recommend the news article's tag to the user. In the process of extracting text eigenvector, we apply Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) method because of its good performance. On the other hand, VGG method is used to extract the image eigenvector. Meanwhile we imply the Autoencoder(AE) to reduce the dimension of the output vector from VGG and we regularize the output vector. Then we combine the obtained text eigenvector with the image eigenvector and send the spliced eigenvector to Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP) to classify the given news. Finally, we predict and recommend the tag of the article to the user. Experimental results show that our method has obtained good results on the Ifeng News dataset. Compared with traditional CNN, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) and other methods that only recommend news based on the text eigenvector, our method achieves good results. For example, our method's accuracy in the test set is 16.1% higher than CNN and 58.2% higher than LSTM.},

abstract = {News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them discover relevant articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift.Deep Learning (DL) have achieved a great success in complex domains, such as computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine translation, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. Therefore, it became a mainstream approach in Recommender Systems research only since 2016.The main objective of this research is the investigation, design, implementation and evaluation of a Meta-Architecture for personalized news recommendations using deep neural networks.As information about users' past interactions is scarce in such cold-start scenario, user context and session information are explicitly modeled, as well as past user sessions, when available. Users' past behaviors and item features are both considered in an hybrid session-aware recommendation approach. The recommendation task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for user sessions: "what is the next most likely article a user might read in a session?"This paper presents the research methodology for this Doctoral research, the proposed Meta-Architecture and some preliminary results, as well as the next research challenges.},

Semantics-driven variants such as SF-IDF additionally take into account term meaning by exploiting synsets from semantic lexicons. However, they ignore the various semantic relationships between synsets, providing only for a limited understanding of news semantics. Moreover, semantics-based weighting techniques are not able to handle -- often crucial -- named entities, which are often not present in semantic lexicons. Hence, we extend SF-IDF by also considering the synset semantic relationships, and by employing named entity similarities using Bing page counts. Our proposed method, Bing-SF-IDF+, outperforms TF-IDF and SF-IDF in terms of F1-scores and kappa statistics based on a news data set.},

abstract = {The GDPR has a significant impact on the way users interact with technologies, especially the everyday platforms used to personalize news and related forms of information. This paper presents the initial results from a study whose primary objective is to empirically test those platforms' level of compliance with the so-called 'right to explanation'. Four research topics considered as gaps in existing legal and HCI scholarship originated from the project's initial phase, namely (1) GDPR compliance through user-centered design; (2) the inclusion of values in the system; (3) design considerations regarding interaction strategies, algorithmic experience, transparency, and explanations; and (4) technical challenges. The second phase is currently ongoing and allows us to make some observations regarding the registration process and the privacy policies of three categories of news actors: first-party content providers, news aggregators and social media platforms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a personalized news recommendation system that combines effective ways of understanding new articles with novel ways of modelling evolving user interest profiles to deliver relevant news articles to a user. A news article is represented as a taxonomy of hierarchical abstractions that capture different semantic facets of the news story. A users interest profile is modelled as an evolving interest over these facets. Users interest in individual articles is determined using a novel SWL (select-watch-leave) interest modelling framework that leverages on a detailed analysis of his usage history. Initial performance comparisons with state-of-the art personalized ranking approaches[2] are promising.},
