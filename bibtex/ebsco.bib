Abstract = {Algorithms are increasingly making decisions regarding what news articles should be shown to online users. In recent times, unhealthy outcomes from these systems have been highlighted including their vulnerability to amplifying small differences and offering less choice to readers. In this paper we present and study a new class of feedback models that exhibit a variety of self-organizing behaviors. In addition to showing important emergent properties, our model generalizes the popular "top-N news recommender systems" in a manner that provides media managers a mechanism to guide the emergent outcomes to mitigate potentially unhealthy outcomes driven by the self-organizing dynamics. We use complex adaptive systems framework to model the popularity evolution of news articles. In particular, we use agent-based simulation to model a reader's behavior at the microscopic level and study the impact of various simulation hyperparameters on overall emergent phenomena.

Abstract = {Recommender systems are widely applied in digital platforms such as news websites to personalize services based on user preferences. In news websites, most of users are anonymous and the only available data is sequences of items in anonymous sessions. Due to this, typical collaborative filtering methods, which are highly applied in many applications, are not effective in news recommendations. In this context, session-based recommenders are able to recommend next items given the sequence of previous items in the active session. Neighborhood-based session-based recommenders have been shown to be highly effective compared to more sophisticated approaches. In this study, we propose scenarios to make these session-based recommender systems diversity-aware and to address the filter bubble phenomenon. The filter bubble phenomenon is a common concern in news recommendation systems and it occurs when the system narrows the information and deprives users of diverse information. The results of a)},

Abstract = {News recommendations distinguishes from general content recommendations as it takes in consideration news freshness, sparsity, monotony and time. Recent works approach these features using hybrid Collaborative-Content-based Filtering methods, adapting clustering techniques to handle sparsity and monotony without considering the effects that different clustering methods may have over recommendation results. Such studies often evaluate the results of varying different parameters individually, ignoring possible interaction effects between them. They also base their results on metrics such as accuracy and recall that are sensitive to bias. To investigate the importance of clustering method selection to News Recommender System results we evaluated the effects of different traditional techniques in recommending news articles. We implemented an algorithm that used a hybrid Collaborative-Content-based Filtering method to incorporate user behavior, user interest, article popularity and time ef)},

Abstract = {Although the importance of trust in recommender systems is widely recognized, the actual mechanisms of trust propagation and trust preservation are poorly understood. This is partly due to the fact that trust is a complex notion, which is typically context dependent, subjective, dynamic and not always transitive or symmetrical. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the notion of trust in news recommendation and discusses the advantages of modeling this notion using Defeasible Logic Programming, a general-purpose defeasible argumentation formalism based on logic programming. In the proposed framework, users can express explicit trust statements on news reports, news sources and other users. Trust is then modeled and propagated using a dialectical process supported by a Defeasible Logic Programming interpreter. A set of basic postulates for trust and their representation by means of defeasible rules is presented. The suitability of the approach is investigated with a set of illu)},

Abstract = {Abstract: Mobile web news services, which served by mobile service operators collecting news articles from diverse news contents providers, provide articles sorted by category or on the basis of attributes, such as the time at which they were posted. The mobile web should provide easy access to the categories or news contents preferred by users because user interface of wireless devices, particularly cell phones is limited for browsing between contents. This paper presents a mobile web news recommendation system (MONERS) that incorporates news article attributes and user preferences with regard to categories and news articles. User preference of news articles are estimated by aggregating news article importance and recency, user preference change, and user segment’s preference on news categories and articles. Performance of MONERS was tested in an actual mobile web environment; news organized by category had more page hits, while recommended news had a higher overall article read rati)},

Abstract = {This study contributes with in-depth knowledge on how algorithmic news recommendation is adopted within the Scandinavian daily press and how notions of gatekeeping affect the use of these systems. News recommender systems provide news organisations with new opportunities to offer more relevant and personalised news experiences, but their increasing use has also raised several concerns about whether and how algorithms should undertake important editorial decisions. Current literature offers only limited empirical insight into the actual use of these technologies in journalism, and this study is the first to map the use of and perceptions on algorithmic news recommendation within the Scandinavian news market. Drawing on interviews with all 19 national newspapers within the Scandinavian daily press, the findings reveal that while most newspapers use news recommender systems in some form, the extent of their use is still limited due to concerns over the shared news sphere and a reluctance)},

Abstract = {• Accurate and Novel Session-based News Recommendations. • Development of a stream-based version of SimRank algorithm. • Providing News Suggestions over Time-evolving Graphs. Recommender systems are among the most widespread applications of artificial intelligence techniques. For instance, news recommender systems serve users in managing the overload of information they come across when accessing news portals. Obviously, in the news domain time-awareness of recommendation approaches are crucial. However, most of these approaches missed to consider user sessions, which group the items that a user interacted with. In this paper, we study the problem of session-based recommendations by running SimRank on time-evolving heterogeneous graphs. In particular, we construct a dynamic heterogeneous multi-partite graph and adjust SimRank to run on it by using different (i) sliding time window sizes, (ii) sub-graphs used for model learning and (iii) sequential article weighting strategies.

Abstract = {Recommender systems help people cope with the problem of information overload. A recently proposed adaptive news recommender model [M. Medo, Y.-C. Zhang, T. Zhou, Europhys. Lett. 88, 38005 (2009)] is based on epidemic-like spreading of news in a social network. By means of agent-based simulations we study a 'good get richer' feature of the model and determine which attributes are necessary for a user to play a leading role in the network. We further investigate the filtering efficiency of the model as well as its robustness against malicious and spamming behaviour. We show that incorporating user reputation in the recommendation process can substantially improve the outcome.

Abstract = {Abstract: Ensemble methods have been successfully used in the past to improve recommender systems; however, they have never been studied with incremental recommendation algorithms. Many online recommender systems deal with continuous, potentially fast, and unbounded flows of data—big data streams—and often need to be responsive to fresh user feedback, adjusting recommendations accordingly. This is clear in tasks such as social network feeds, news recommender systems, automatic playlist completion, and other similar applications. Batch ensemble approaches are not suitable to perform continuous learning, given the complexity of retraining new models on demand. In this paper, we adapt a general purpose online bagging algorithm for top‐N recommendation tasks and propose two novel online bagging methods specifically tailored for recommender systems. We evaluate the three approaches, using an incremental matrix factorization algorithm for top‐N recommendation with positive‐only user feedbac)},

It is unclear, however, to what degree they are aware of these outlets and familiar with the concept of alternative media. This study investigates the relation between exposure to alternative media and knowledge of them, taking the role of APNC into account. Analyzing representative survey data of German Internet users, we find a gap: While many individuals report to use alternative media, few of them are able to name alternative media titles matching scholarly conceptions. Although the use of APNC increases self-reported exposure to alternative media, it does not improve actual knowledge of them. All in all, many Internet users have little awareness of alternative media and do not clearly distinguish between different types of sources they come across online.
