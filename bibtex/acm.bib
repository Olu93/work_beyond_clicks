abstract = {News article recommendation differs in several ways from other well-known types of recommender systems such as for music and movies. First, freshness represents an important aspect. Sometimes, freshness is deemed more important than relevancy. Second, similarity between news articles does not necessarily reflect their relatedness. For instance, two news articles might share a majority of words. Still, their actual topic might differ. Third, news are typically published in a rather unstructured format. In contrast, structured data such as social graphs facilitate pre-processing steps. Fourth, news readers might have special preferences on some particular events which recommender systems can barely predict. Fifth, serendipities (i. e., variety in recommended news articles) represent a crucial property of a news recommender system. Contrarily to music recommendations, users avoid to re-consume an item. Thus, news recommender systems are required to provide diverse sets of items in order to assure not to recommend monotonously. Sixth, breaking or trendy news might have a high relevance even though the appear completely unrelated to the individual user profile. Seventh, the has not yet established consensus on how to evaluate news recommender systems. We typically observe implicit preferences as users interact with news portals. Those preferences do not exhibit a graded relevance. Thus, well-established evaluation criteria based on ratings (e.g., root mean squared error) cannot be applied. Another set of challenges arises from the context of news recommendation. Recommender systems are known to struggle with so-called "cold-start users" (i. e., users form whom no preferences are available yet). News portals typically refrain to require users to login prior to read news articles. Hence, there is a large fraction of users who appear to be "cold-start users". The lack of sufficiently many interaction to established trustworthy user profiles entails further challenges. Inferring interest signals suffers from incomplete profiles. Additionally, items' relevance is time dependent and diminishes with time progressing. Another challenge related to the context arises from the increasingly frequent use of mobile devices to read news articles such as tablets and smart phones. Those have a limited space available to display news and related recommendations. News recommender systems have to deal with this issue thus applying suited layout mechanisms to fit the content to the available screen. Finally, news recommender systems face numerous technical challenges. Those challenges include minimizing response time improve user experience, scaling to the large amount of requests to avoid time outs, providing flexibility to incorporate new recommendation methods or adjust parameter settings for existing implementations, and guarantee a reliable service whom user can access at any time.},

abstract = {In prior work we addressed a major problem faced by media sites with popularity based recommender systems such as the top-10 list of most liked or most clicked posts. We showed that the hard cutoff used in these systems to generate the "Top N"lists is prone to unduly penalizing good articles that may have just missed the cutoff. A solution to this was to generate recommendations probabilistically, which is an approach that has been shown to be robust against some manipulation techniques as well. The aim of this research is to introduce a class of probabilistic news recommender systems that incorporates widely practiced recommendation techniques as a special case. We establish our results in a special case of two articles using the urn models with feedback mechanism from probability theory.},

abstract = {The broad motivation for our research is to build manipulation resistant news recommender systems. However, there can be several different algorithms that are used to generate news recommendations, and the strategies for manipulation resistance are likely specific to the algorithm (or class of algorithm) employed. In this paper we will focus on a common method used by many media sites of recommending the N most read (or popular) articles (e.g. New York Times, BBC, Wall Street Journal all prominently use this). Through simulation results we show that whereas recommendation of the N most read articles is easily susceptible to manipulation, a simple probabilistic variant is more robust to common manipulation strategies. Further, for the "N most read" recommender, probabilistic selection has other desirable properties. Specifically, the (N+1)th article, which may have "just" missed making the cutoff, is unduly penalized under common user models. Small differences initially are easily amplified -- an observation that can be used by manipulators. Probabilistic selection, on the other hand, creates no such artificial penalty. We also use classical results from urn models to derive theoretical results for special cases.},

abstract = {With the increasing ubiquity of access to online news sources, the news recommender systems are becoming widely popular in recent days. However, providing interesting news for each user is a challenging task in highly-dynamic news domain. Many news aggregator sites such as Google News suggest its users to provide sign in to the system for getting user-specific (relevant) news articles. For more generic news recommendation, the system collects user click history and page access pattern implicitly. Often the users are not sure about the usage of the collected and consolidated data by the recommender systems which they usually trade for receiving the news recommendation. Privacy of user identity, user behavior in terms of page access patterns contributes to the overall privacy risks in the news domain. This review paper discusses the current state-of-the-art of privacy risks and existing privacy preserving approaches in the news domain from user perspective.},

abstract = {Media monitoring services allow their customers, mostly companies, to receive, on a daily basis, a list of documents from mass media that discuss topics relevant to the company. However, media monitoring services often generate these lists by using keyword-filtering techniques, which introduce many false positives. Hence, before the end users, i.e., the employees of the company, may consult these lists and find relevant documents, a human editor must inspect the keyword-filtered documents and remove the false positives. This is a time consuming job. In this paper we present a recommender system that aims at reducing the number of documents that the editor needs to inspect every day. The proposed solution classifies documents (represented with TF-IDF and embeddings features) using techniques trained on data containing the editors’ past actions (i.e. the removals of false positives). The proposed technique is shown to be able to correctly predict the true positives, thus reducing the number of documents that the editor needs to inspect every day.},

abstract = { This paper proposes a vision and research agenda for the next generation of news recommender systems (RS), called the table d’h\^{o}te approach. A table d’h\^{o}te (translates as host’s table) meal is a sequence of courses that create a balanced and enjoyable dining experience for a guest. Likewise, we believe news RS should strive to create a similar experience for the users by satisfying the news-diet needs of a user. While extant news RS considers criteria such as diversity and serendipity, and RS bundles have been studied for other contexts such as tourism, table d’h\^{o}te goes further by ensuring the recommended articles satisfy a diverse set of user needs in the right proportions and in a specific order. In table d’h\^{o}te, available articles need to be stratified based on the different ways that news can create value for the reader, building from theories and empirical research in journalism and user engagement. Using theories and empirical research from communication on the uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) consumers derive from media, we define two main strata in a table d’h\^{o}te news RS, each with its own substrata: 1) surveillance, which consists of information the user needs to know, and 2) serendipity, which are the articles offering unexpected surprises. The diversity of the articles according to the defined strata and the order of the articles within the list of recommendations are also two important aspects of the table d’h\^{o}te in order to give the users the most effective reading experience. We propose our vision, link it to the existing concepts in the RS literature, and identify challenges for future research.},

However, the common item-based clustering technologies could not quite suit for news recommender system, since the news events evolve fast and continuous. In this paper, we suggest using technologies of TDT to group news items instead of common item-based clustering technologies.

For online setting, context-tree recommender systems which profile the users in real-time improve the click-through rate by up to 35%. The visit length also increases by a factor of 2.5. Our experience holds important lessons for the evaluation of recommender systems with offline data as well as for the use of the click-through rate as a performance indicator.},

abstract = {Several recommender systems have been proposed in the literature. Some of them address the problem of recommending news to users of newspaper sites. The context of online news presents some particularities: highly dynamic data volume, users access without registration, quick accesses of a few readings, and content is time-dependent. Online newspapers generate in real-time the recommendation lists with few items. The recommenders have a short time to model access, create the list, and present it to the user. All these characteristics make the problem of news recommendation an exciting challenge that has been studied by the academic community with new proposals. However, scarce works study users reading behavior before proposing new methods. In this work, we are interested in characterizing online newspaper users via stochastic models and using attributes extracted from this characterization in recommender systems. First results demonstrate that models who use only information from the recent past are the best. Next, we will look at whether these models are best, varying data contexts,&nbsp;and&nbsp;how to generate more personalized models. Finally, we intend to add all the knowledge in a recommender system, improving or creating a new one.},
